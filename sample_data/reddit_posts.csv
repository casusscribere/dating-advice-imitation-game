My sister has aggressive breast cancer, and I needed to step up for her and my daughters sake.  My husband has been very supportive throughout this whole upheaval in our lives. My only concern or issue is that he no longer touches me or shows me any romantic affection.  Everything is just formal and business like. He treats our 2 kids and my daughter equally. Going so far as to start a college fund for her.

I thought that after some time, things would get better, but I was wrong. This seems to be our new normal. I have tried to talk about it, and he just shuts that down. I have been literally throwing myself at him, and he just walks away. Last night, I did the whole seduction route. Kids were with his parents,  cooked his favorite beef stroganoff,  bottle of wine, and new lingerie.  And all I got was a thanks for the great dinner. When I pressed for more, he just said he couldn't and apologized. 5 months of no affection at all. It is doing a number on my mental health.  Does anyone have any advice that can help my situation?

Update,  we had a fight yesterday at work. I pushed for some answers from him. He finally said he feels disgusted at even the thought of touching me now. ",1754149582.0,,1754487552.0,False,True,N/A,,True,False,False,False,False,0.99,N/A
1,2026/2/27,17: 8:59,1ljx8by,relationshipadvice,I [20F] feel disgusted and betrayed by my boyfriend [21M] after what I found in his apartment… I think I want to leave him,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationshipadvice/comments/1ljx8by/i_20f_feel_disgusted_and_betrayed_by_my_boyfriend/,/r/relationshipadvice/comments/1ljx8by/i_20f_feel_disgusted_and_betrayed_by_my_boyfriend/,111,Flashy-Opening1149,42,"I [20F] really need advice. I feel disgusted, hurt, and honestly betrayed by my boyfriend [21M], and I don’t know what to do. I love him so much he feels like my other half but something happened tonight that I don't know if I can move past.

When we first started dating, I noticed his apartment was... dirty. Not just messy, but truly dirty. It always seemed like he did a super surface-level clean whenever I came over. I tried to be understanding he’s young, living alone for the first time, and I didn’t want to make him feel ashamed. I gave him grace and tried to be supportive, not judgmental.

 But there were signs. Big ones.

I wasn’t allowed to shower at his place at first, and I didn’t understand why until one day I peeked behind the shower curtain. The tub was completely brown, covered in hair and grime. I was honestly disgusted. I told him how it made me feel and asked him to work on being cleaner. And he did. His bathroom has been spotless ever since.

There were other things: his dog used to pee and poop in the kitchen and he’d just wipe it up with paper towels. He would leave food out for days, the sink would pile up with dishes. I kept having conversations with him trying to be kind, constructive and most of all UNDERSTANDING and he really stepped up. He bought cleaning supplies, a mop, a gate for the dog, stopped leaving food out. Over time, his apartment completely transformed. He even got furniture, a real bed frame it actually  looked really nice.

So, I started staying over more. He works night shifts, so I’d hang out, take care of the dog, sometimes see him during his lunch breaks. Everything felt okay... until I started noticing bugs at night. Roaches. I told him about it a month ago. He seemed surprised, downplayed it, but told me he cleaned everything, bought roach spray, the whole nine yards.

I hadn’t been to his place in a few weeks, and I came over tonight. The bathroom looked clean. But I saw a roach again, so I decided to wipe everything down just to sanitize everything bc it appeared to be clean. But then I opened the cabinet under the sink...

And I found plates of rotting food and bugs crawling everywhere.

I don’t know if I can explain the way I felt. Disgusted. Shocked. Betrayed. I packed all my stuff and left immediately. I couldn’t even think I just HAD to get out. When I called to tell him what I saw, he was clearly embarrassed and apologized a lot. He sounded genuinely upset. But idk if I can be understanding anymore.

My husband [31M] is a stay-at-home dad and handles all the school drop-offs and pick-ups for our son. Recently, I mentioned that one of the moms at the school texted me to grab coffee sometime. A few days later, my husband admitted almost reluctantly that he had brought her chocolates and cookies. He drove about 30 min to a speciality store and that's where he got them. He was buying other stuff for himself there as well. Oh, and I've never met her. 

He said he was afraid she might mention it to me, so he confessed, but only after I brought her up. He apologized, but when I tried to have a deeper conversation about it, he got really angry and told me to just drop it. That reaction honestly made things feel worse.

Later, I casually spoke to another parent at the school and she mentioned (without me asking much) that he comes across as a very flirty guy. I had no idea people viewed him that way. 
I’m just feeling a mix of confusion, disappointment, and insecurity. He put effort into buying and delivering sweets to another woman who, by the way, is married with several kids. I don’t want to overreact, but I also don’t want to ignore something that feels off.
	
Any thoughts or advice would be appreciated.

He’s everything I’ve ever hoped and wished for in a partner; he’s very caring, romantic, sweet, and makes me feel the happiest and most stable I’ve ever felt with anyone. He spends a lot of his time and money reassuring me of how sure he is about making me his wife. We’re very compatible together and our life views and goals are perfectly aligned. He’s far along within his career job and offered to support me fully as I finish college and is eager to have a child together one day, which is one of my biggest goals in life. Everything about him is all I’ve ever begged for in my past relationships where I’ve never been made to feel so special to someone.

About a month and a half into us seriously dating, we decided to introduce each other to our families by taking a family day trip together. We reserved everyone’s tickets for Saturday and met up for dinner on Friday night. That night, he dropped a huge bomb on me knowing I couldn’t cancel our trip for the next day without causing a huge scene and confusion for both our families. He fills me in about the fact that he has 2 kids from 2 different woman. The children are 7 and 9 and the mothers have custody of them. He pays child support monthly and gets visitations with his kids every other week for 2 days. He explained that he was never married to his baby mamas and both relationships ended because he was cheated on both times. He said he doesn’t want this news to change anything between us because he’s very serious about our future together and he doesn’t want “stupid” decisions he made when he was way younger to ruin what we have.

I don’t have children and am very conflicted about whether or not I should stay with him. He makes me happy in ways I’ve never experienced before but I just don’t know how I can be a step mom. Its so hard to accept that he has ties to two other women for the rest of his life and that if I do have his child, he’d be responsible for 3 children at that point. Whenever I bring up these concerns to him, he says that this kind of family tree was normalized for him while growing up while I experienced a more stable family dynamic. My parents have stayed together their entire lives and have only had children with each other whereas my boyfriend has a lot of step and half siblings. He said he prefers that he has a bunch of different siblings from both sides of his parents and he says I’m just not used to that family dynamic. He reassures me his kids won’t make him love me any less and he proves that by making so much time for me despite his responsibilities outside our relationship. I just don’t know whether I should keep things going between us because I’m beyond happy with him and I know he’s not a bad person at all so it’s difficult for me to justify leaving him when he does everything he possibly can for me. I just don’t know how to accept the fact he has kids, every time he spends money on me I feel guilty because I feel like I’m taking it away from his kids. When we spend time together, I feel guilty because I feel like I’m taking time away from him spending it with his kids. He says I’ll get used to it but I can’t see my views changing and I don’t know if it’s because it’s still fresh for me.

I have been a complete crash out these last couple of months due to these factors and my own issues with mental health. I’m now In therapy and doing much better but we are on a break because he couldn’t stand me anymore. I understand I haven’t been myself for a while.

Before the break I’ve set some boundaries and how I’m not comfortable with him exploring other people. I have no desire  exploring others because I only want him and I love him. 

He’s the one who initiated the break and Yes we are still in contact, he texts and calls me everyday. He agreed to the boundaries at first but now he’s in a different country to visit family and I have brought up this boundary again to him and he said to me quote on quote

 “I’m sorry if this hurts you but I’m not going back on this” (the exploring others) “it’s summer time and I want to have fun. I like attention from other people even if it’s meaningless. I don’t want anyone else tho and I’m going to come back” 

I have been crying for hours because our break is almost over and this came out of nowhere.I have yet to reply back to him after he said that 

What would you guys do in a situation like this? please help 

UPDATE‼️(thank you to everyone for listening and pouring into me.) Being with someone like this has made go crazy and question if there was something wrong with me for a long time, my confidence has been destroyed but you’ve all picked me up and guided me today.

Yes I’m sad and I cry a lot but at the same time I don’t feel like I’m getting pulled towards him, more like just grieving what it was and what could’ve been if they took what we had serious. I feel myself being hopeful and it wasn’t at all as scary as it was in my head, leaving a 3 year long connection. I can’t wait to wipe the rest of these tears and see what all is there that’s in store for me and never look back.

He has been estranged from his parents for a while due to them not approving when he came out as gay, and he only really got back in touch with them in the past couple of months, so it was a really big deal when he decided to introduce me to them. When we arrived at his parents place his mum welcomed us and she was very lovely, but as we walked into the loungeroom I met his father. When I was younger (23) I worked as an escort for a few years to help me when I was studying at University, I had mostly one off and random customers but I also had a few regulars. His father was one of them. He had hired me at least once a fortnight for 2 years, normally booking for 2-3 hours at a time so we had spent a lot of time together. When he saw me he went noticibly pale, and the atmosphere got super awkward. My boyfriend and his mum didn't notice and she proceeded to give us a tour of the house. When dinner was ready my boyfriend went to help his mum with playing up and left me alone with his father. He immediately told me to not tell anyone, and also told me he wanted me to leave his son, but I said I wouldn't and that he didn't really have any sway because I had all the evidence (he sent me many photos of himself and he even recorded us a couple of times). The rest of dinner was ok, his mum asked a lot about my life and his father stayed silent. After dinner we left and my boyfriend apologised for his father, saying he usually wasn't so quiet but blamed it on him being uncomfortable with out relationship, which he wasn't wrong.
I want to tell my boyfriend about everything but I don't know how to bring it up or how to say it the right way. He knows I used to be an escort and he's ok with it, but I don't know how he'll react to me having slept with his father.

EDIT FOR UPDATE:

The day after I posted this I decided to tell him the truth, I was considering not telling him but I couldn't sleep or eat properly and I just felt sick. I sat him down and said to him that when I worked as an escort his father was one of my regular clients. He thought I was joking at first but when is tarted crying he realised I wasn't. He was silent for a while before he said that he needed some space and time, barely looking at me as he packed a bag and left. Over the next couple of days I had messaged him and tried calling but I never got a response. Finally on Friday night he came home and said we needed to talk. I expected him to tell me that he wanted to split, I was already prepared for that and had spent the past few days packing up a bunch of my stuff so that I could leave as easily as possible. Instead he pulled me in and hugged me tight before he started sobbing, I started crying to and we sat there for what felt like forever before we both calmed down.

When he was able to talk he said that he loved me more than anyone else and even with this he couldn't see a future for himself that I wasn't in. He told me that he doesn't blame me and that it isn't my fault at all, he also said that he's going to be confronting his father because his mum deserves better than what he's done to her. We've spent this weekend discussing our next steps, were going to go to therapy because he's feeling uncomfortable with intamcy which is totally understandable. We haven't told his mum yet and we don't know how it's going to play out but we're optimistic for our own relationship for now. Thanks for all the opinions and advice people gave, it really helped me get the courage to tell and I guess this is the best case scenario for now.",1748854633.0,,1749550488.0,False,True,N/A,,False,False,False,False,False,0.82,N/A
7,2026/2/27,17: 8:59,1pmgv9p,relationshipadvice,Am I [35F] justified in leaving my partner [35M] of 18 years after he has improved so much?,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationshipadvice/comments/1pmgv9p/am_i_35f_justified_in_leaving_my_partner_35m_of/,/r/relationshipadvice/comments/1pmgv9p/am_i_35f_justified_in_leaving_my_partner_35m_of/,64,theosporin,41,"I’m not entirely sure where to begin, but I’ll try to lay this out clearly.

I have been with the same partner for a little over 18 years. We started dating in high school in a long distance relationship, and about three years in, we moved in together.

From early on, my partner struggled significantly with emotional expression and mental health. He was emotionally shut down to the point where I couldnt talk to him about anything meaningful, he would simply withdraw.

When we moved in together, he didn’t work or contribute to household responsibilities. I paid for everything and handled all of the cleaning, planning, and daily logistics. At the time, I didn’t immediately resent this. I grew up in an abusive household where my mother was trapped because she couldnt afford to leave, so having financial control gave me a sense of safety..even though, in hindsight, I didnt take control at all.

Over time, the weight of it became overwhelming. I was responsible for all the cleaning, bills, and meal planning while we lived in this awful apartment. My partner largely shut down during this period, and I believe he was deeply depressed because of our living conditions.

Eventually, I got a better job, climbed the company ladder, and earned significantly more which allowed us to move into a much better home. Our physical environment improved, and so did some aspects of our lives. My partner began making friends and seemed healthier, but I was still carrying nearly all of the responsibility. I ultimately hired a cleaning service because I couldn’t manage everything on my own and still have time or energy for myself.

By around 2019, the stress had taken a toll on me, and I stopped having sex with my partner. We went months without intimacy. Then, one night while I was asleep, he violated me. He did it in a way that made it clear he didn’t want to wake me. I froze. A week later, he did it again, and I froze again.

I didn’t confront him at the time. Instead, I began sleeping on the couch, telling him it was because of his snoring. In reality, I felt unsafe, uncomfortable, and deeply unsettled by the idea of being touched.

Shortly after, the pandemic began. I continued sleeping on the couch throughout that period while also caring for my disabled mother and brother, all while financially supporting both myself and my partner.

During the pandemic, my partner’s mental health improved. He began treatment for ADHD, became more emotionally open, and started contributing more around the house. At this point, chores are roughly split 30/70, which is an improvement. We’ve discussed sharing bills more equally, but instead of managing payments, he tells me to “just pull what you need” from his account. This is stressful, as he doesn’t track due dates and frequently moves large sums to his credit card, leaving me unsure of what’s actually available.

It has now been six years since the incidents, and I have remained on the couch the entire time. Last year, I finally confronted him about what happened. He denied it,to me,despite the fact that we were the only two people present. That denial felt deeply insulting and invalidating.

Here is where I feel torn.

My partner has genuinely grown in many ways. He expresses his emotions now. He cries when he’s sad. He is kind to my cat. He helps around the house. He is willing to contribute financially. We’ve both been in therapy, individually and as a couple, though I never found a way to bring up this specific trauma in couples therapy. He is engaged in his own therapy and seems to benefit from it.

Because of this growth, leaving him now feels strange and complicated.

At the same time, I don’t believe I can truly forgive what happened. I have tried. I went to therapy. I worked on myself. I genuinely wanted to move forward, but I don’t think I can keep pretending that this wound has healed.

I’m also deeply afraid of what will happen to him if I leave. He has relied on me for so long, and I don’t know how he would manage on his own.

I feel conflicted, guilty, and stuck...torn between recognizing his growth and honoring the fact that something fundamental was broken, and I don’t know if it can be repaired.

Would I be justified in leaving?

My wife and I recently had a serious conversation about our sex life, and it was uncomfortable. 

I mentioned we should probably see a therapist. And I think that scared her a little, so she asked why. I said because it's been a decade and we still can't get on the same page about sex. She told me early on in our relationship that she was a ""big ol 5"" (likes to initiate). But she _never_ initiates. And if I initiate, there's no clear signal when it's a yes. I have to just keep pushing until, surprise, today is the day we have it. Or not and she's annoyed.

To insert quickly, early in our relationship I was annoying and overbearing when ""in the mood.""  But I've matured and changed tactics quite a bit. Now it's small love notes on her desk, cooking her favorite meal, doing a few loads of laundry, making sure the hugs last longer than normal, etc.

Anyway, back to the conversation, she said that sex is annoying because it takes so long. The prep, the act, the cleanup, etc. At this point she said the first ""wtf"" thing for me: ""I don't have to orgasm. You want me to have one, so you do oral which makes the whole process take even longer."" 

My brain was reeling after that statement. To clarify, I [34M] always want my wife [33F] to have an orgasm during sex. To make sure this happens, I try to always give her oral as part of foreplay. I have never received oral, but I do it for her (golden rule I guess). This statement upset me, but I tempered any anger and tried to keep digging.

I asked what she would prefer instead. Why have sex if she does not want an orgasm? For me that's what sex is about, it's the goal at the end of the journey. She says her favorite part is ""feeling close to you."" I ask ""Like snuggling and watching TV together. We are close then."" She says yes. I ask the dreaded question ""So, for you, sex is about the same as snuggling and watching a movie."" She shrugs and says ""kinda"". 

That conversation was a week ago. Since then I have watched more tv with her, because it's an easy thing to do and if it's the same as an orgasm for her, hell yeah. But I have completely avoided flirting or any ideas of sex because my head is full of negative thoughts. How can I have sex with someone who doesn't even want to orgasm? It feels like I am using them to get off.

I'm so confused and lost. I will take any advice, or answer any questions. 

Side note, rule #3 should be changed. I spent an hour writing/rewriting this post to adhere to the rule and post it, and I had to remove some of the conversation between my wife and I because it included questions written in a way that rule #3 would not allow.

11,2026/2/27,17: 8:59,1l62dp2,relationshipadvice,I [32F] think my husband [31M] and gay best friend had sex or something based on the events that occurred,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationshipadvice/comments/1l62dp2/i_32f_think_my_husband_31m_and_gay_best_friend/,/r/relationshipadvice/comments/1l62dp2/i_32f_think_my_husband_31m_and_gay_best_friend/,61,No_October_1077,22,"My husband and I have been together since college. 

I think last year they had sex here’s the reasons why; 

1. They were hanging out and working together for extra money.

2. My husband started acting manic after I found the poppers in the car. But he said he found it at a location where that’s totally possible he found them.

3. I called my husband and I swear I heard my friend say something in the background. I asked him who was that? He said it was nothing. I didn’t care if they were together, it’s never been an issue.

4. My friend described having sex with a married man and the guys wife called on the phone and he had to be quiet. He said something and she asked “what was that?” 

5. My friend described my husband’s ‘finishing move’ 

6. My husband and I haven’t been intimate for almost a year now since the alleged incident. There’s some sort of weird wall. He’s very good at listening but has nothing to say back now.

7. He says he has ED because he’s over weight. He has really let himself go since last year. He won’t let me touch him and he won’t do anything with me. I can’t touch him at all and he makes me feel very weird about it. We can do a side hug. It’s embarrassing. We use to be so physical. I try to be understanding and maybe it is an ED issue.

8. My friend literally abruptly moved to another country on a whim after receiving a job offer and was staying with family members he barely knew. But he has NEVER been adventurous. As long as I’ve know him, it’s not like him at all. He’s completely miserable over there and can’t afford to come back.

I don’t know how to bring this up with either of them. It’s been almost a year now and nothing has improved… 

My husband has really let himself go. I’m talking poor hygiene, uncut hair, dirty, and overworking himself to death now. He swears up and down he doesn’t have depression. He goes to counseling with me when Ive requested. He hasn’t been around much due to work and I’m just not attracted to my husband at all at this point. He smells terrible. We’ve had a highly sexual and intimate relationship for over 12 years and the sudden change in everything has made me question myself, him, everything. Plus I feel like a creep almost because I feel like total opposite. I give him space to do whatever he needs to but it just let us quietly float apart even further. 

I’m the breadwinner at this point and he’s struggling to handle any of his personal responsibilities. Therapy isn’t getting us anywhere.

12,2026/2/27,17: 8:59,1l9oxq0,relationshipadvice,Should I [41M] sleep with my best friend [39F] even though she has terminal cancer?,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationshipadvice/comments/1l9oxq0/should_i_41m_sleep_with_my_best_friend_39f_even/,/r/relationshipadvice/comments/1l9oxq0/should_i_41m_sleep_with_my_best_friend_39f_even/,56,PersonWithARealName,23,"This is a very delicate situation so please bear with me. 

I've got my best friend Mary who I've known for a very long time. We met in college when her roommate dated my roommate, and we bonded wing-manning for our friends. We've been pretty inseparable ever since. I was her first roommate once we graduated. We lived in two different apartments together for almost 6 years. Even when we got our own places and careers, we've stayed best friends. We always joked I'd be her maid of honor and she'd be my best man if we ever found a spouse. Legit my favorite person on the planet. 

Mary was unfortunately diagnosed with a somewhat rare form of cancer in early 2021. It's been a roller-coaster ride since then, but at this point her condition is terminal. She's not at the level of needing hospice yet, her team thinks she has maybe 8 months before it gets to that, but she's not exactly in great shape. 

Her only family are a couple aunts she calls on holidays and her sister, who was never super close to Mary, but they've reconnected in recent years. Other than that, she has me and our group of friends who have been just the most amazing people, coming together to help with everything going on. They say this sort of thing really reveals a man's character, and I feel so fortunate to be surrounded by so many upstanding individuals. 

She puts on a brave face for a lot of our other friends but she lets it drop with me. She doesn't often want to have the big talks about life and death, she tries not to focus on those existential questions, but when she does I'm the one she turns to. We're very close, and have only grown closer these last 4 years. I am astounded by her resilience, and she said she appreciates that I treat her like my best friend Mary and not my best friend Mary who has cancer. She actually had to sit a couple of our other friends down and basically beg them to make fun of her again like they used to. I've never stopped ripping on her bad taste in movies and shit like that, never walked on eggshells with her, which I guess helps her feel normal. 

Now on to the issue. 

Mary had a boyfriend of about a year when she was diagnosed. He left her a year later. It was amicable, the cancer was unexpected and strained and already rocky relationship, but it was definitely still very difficult for her to go through. She's been on a handful dates in the past couple years, but hasn't been on one in a while and I don't think she ever saw any dude more than twice.

I bring this up because Mary recently sat me down for a frank talk. She explained to me that she hasn't had sex since her boyfriend left and she wants to rectify that. For a time she was heartbroken, and didn't want to pursue anyone. Then she was focused on her health, and didn't have the time or energy to really pursue anything beyond casual dating, never clicking with the guys she saw anyway. Now that she's faced with her mortality, she's scared she wasted the last years of her romantic life. 

She told me she's been trying to put herself out there for the past year or so, but it is really hard. She explained how much it is hurting her that she's not beautiful anymore. She hates that people can look at her and just see that she's got cancer. That her frailty is so visible. It's a very particular hurt for Mary, who was always a gorgeous and very fit woman. 

I tried to reassure her that she's as beautiful as she ever was, more for showing me her strength of character, but I could tell it felt hollow to her. She told me she's tried Tinder and Bumble, which surprised me as I would think that's the sort of thing we'd normally talk about. She said she was too embarrassed to say anything. Mary's apparently gotten 20 or so matches. She wanted to be upfront about her condition in her bio and used exclusively recent pics, so she thinks that's why the apps haven't worked. 1 dude called her skeletor. I've never had a more violent thought in my life. Most never replied to her first message. A few chatted for a bit but eventually stopped responding, or said something to make her stop responding. There was one dude that talked to her for like 3 weeks, but said he didn't think he could risk falling for a dying woman. I can't imagine what that would feel like to hear. 

She also says she just doesn't have the energy at this point to go to try meet people in person. And honestly, I don't want her going to some place like a bar to try to get laid. Not without my help at least. Plus I'm not sure how successful she'd be at this point. It might be mean, but I don't think the kind of dude looking for a hookup at a bar is going to pursue Mary in her state and that breaks my heart. 

She mentioned mild interest in a guy at one of her therapy groups for terminal patients. The thing is, the therapist running the group was explicit at the start about having boundaries, that a terminal diagnosis can of course create unexpected emotion, and everybody needs to be cognizant of not crossing any lines. She says that really stuck with her. She doesn't feel right pursuing it when she has no idea how he feels about sex and his own diagnosis. She doesn't want to risk adding to his plate or messing with the group's vibe. 

Then Mary looked me in the eye, came out and asked point blank if I would just sleep with her. She was very straight forward, but I could tell this was hard for her and that she had rehearsed her words. I can always tell when she rehearses. She explained that she just wants to feel beautiful one last time before she goes. She wants to feel wanted and she wants to feel passion. That while she never thought of me like that before her diagnosis, I've always been a looker, and how could she not become more attracted to me with the way I've been there for her.

I had no idea how to respond. She was very clear that she didn't want to pressure me into anything, that she knows this is a really big and unusual ask. She told me to take some time to think about it, and to look out for myself too. She doesn't want me to do anything I'll regret when she's gone. I can't believe even now she's worried about me. I told her I would give it some thought and tried to reassure her that there really was no harm in asking. I think she might have been afraid I'd be offended by the request. I'm not. 

I just don't know what to do. While I did always see she her as a beautiful woman, I never really entertained any sexual desire for her outside our first semester together. She made it clear that wasn't the nature of our relationship, and we both kept it strictly platonic from that point on. We've always had a very close friendship. I'm talking call each other on the way home from work just to ask what the other's having for dinner kind of close. We're not the type that have ever labeled our relationship as ""practically brother and sister"" or anything, but when I look back it has always been a little bit like that. Not exactly familial, more like found family, if that makes any sense. The thought of sex with her doesn't feel incestuous, but definitely charged in some undefined way. 

So now I need to make a decision. I'm actually leaning towards saying yes, but I have some concerns.

I don't want to take advantage of what feels like desperation. I know she's a competent adult, and speaking with her it sounds like she's thinking this through and knows what she is doing, but I still have this paranoia that this is the fear of dying alone asking, and not my friend Mary. 

I also don't want to make things awkward, and I just fear that could happen in so many ways. What if we develop a romantic attachment? Or worse, what if only one of us does? What if it doesn't go well and she's just left with regret? What if she wants to do it more? What if it goes well, but we just can't see each other the same way afterwards? We have so little time left together, and I couldn't bear it if something fucked up our dynamic right at the end. I'm trying to make the most of what we have.

I also don't want to be left with some lifelong regret. That feels selfish, but I have to admit I've had the thought. If this ends up hurting either one of us, which I'm not exactly sure it will, but if it does then that will probably last the rest of my life. I don't want some dark cloud hanging over the best friendship I've ever had and ever will have. I'm also worried about someone finding out somehow. I don't know how they would, I trust Mary wouldn't say anything on purpose, but if our friends heard about it I worry they'd think I was some kind of predator. They wouldn't have the context. 

But when I really think about it, if I were in her shoes I imagine I'd want to get laid one last time too. That feels totally natural to me. And while asking a friend for sex would normally cross a line, we're close enough and the circumstances are fucked up enough that I feel like it is okay. That's why I'm leaning yes. I think she would do it for me if the roles were reversed, and it is a totally normal human desire to have. 

When I think about it I believe there's a part of me that *can* want her and show her I want her, but I'm honestly not 100% sure. I'm scared to say yes, try, and find out I can't go through with it. I don't know what that would do to Mary or our friendship. 

I'm totally lost with this, and I don't have anyone in my life I can ask. I brought it up to my therapist, which is where a lot of my thoughts written here were formulated, but the reason I like her as a therapist is that she gives me a place to talk out my own thoughts and doesn't really give much specific advice. So her thoughts boiled down to ""we're two consenting adults in a unique situation, so saying yes isn't inherently wrong, but I have to do what's right for me."" Which...yeah, but not really helpful at the moment. 

I can't tell any of our other friends for sure, and I don't feel comfortable enough to ask anyone in my family for their opinion on this. My instinct is normally to turn to Mary for advice on this sort of thing. Of course I plan to have another sit down talk with her, raising my concerns and getting her take on possible issues. We've never had an issue talking and analyzing choices together. Still, I wanted to run my thoughts by an objective third party to see if maybe I'm out of my mind without realizing it. I want to approach this delicately and preserve Mary's dignity, whether I say yes or no. Any thoughts are appreciated.

13,2026/2/27,17: 8:59,1r0ex8z,relationshipadvice,I [29f] am struggling to get over the words my [34m] husband said to me. What should I do?,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationshipadvice/comments/1r0ex8z/i_29f_am_struggling_to_get_over_the_words_my_34m/,/r/relationshipadvice/comments/1r0ex8z/i_29f_am_struggling_to_get_over_the_words_my_34m/,57,DraconicRacoon,57,"So I won't go into crazy detail but I'll try and keep it brief.

Me (29f) and my husband (34m) have been together for 12 years. When we met I was a teenager. My body was naturally skinny and in fact I'd say I was tiny. I look back and I really felt like I looked like I had a child's body. 

Now I'm 29, I'm 5'8, and 70kg, 154 pounds. I am within healthy BMI but since marriage my husband has been asking me to lose weight.

It started small. Saying jeans didn't suit me because I had a tummy. Saying a dress doesn't sit well on me. That my t-shirt is too tight. Yes I have a belly but I must reiterate I am a healthy weight for my height and age so I know this is purely visual.

He's never said he's concerned for my health, only that he's a very visual person, that he wants me to be the best version of myself, that he didn't sign up to our relationship and marriage for this much weight gain and I need to be in my fittest form so when I have kids I can bounce back.

I was SHOCKED by this revelation. It was like the rug was pulled from beneath me. I stood up for myself eventually and told him how much these words hurt and he told me he's being honest and that he'd expect me to be just as honest with him. He said he has no empathy and that he's basically doing me a kindness by telling me I need to take better care of myself.

I don't take divorce lightly and I'm really scared and worried what it entails. I honestly thought my life would be spent with him. I thought we would have kids and I'm grieving the person I thought I knew and the life I thought I'd have.

I have even asked me if he's happy in this relationship and if he's attracted to me and he said yes. 

He withholds intimacy too and says if he gives me too much compliments and intimacy it will lose its meaning or I'll get egotistical.

Honestly with all the fat shaming he's done I really need those words and actions of affirmation more than ever. He agreed to stop calling me fat but I can't help but think he still thinks I am, even if he doesn't say it. He said he was being honest. And he hasn't done anything to show me he loves my body which would counteract those bad words in my eyes. I don't know what to do.",1770667570.0,,False,False,True,N/A,,False,True,False,False,False,0.91,N/A

I invited my new-ish girlfriend. We’ve been dating for around 4 months, but this will be far from the first party I’ve brought her to. Tonight, she pitched her costume idea, and it wasn’t a cute couples costume, it was “Sexy Baby”. I thought she was joking, so of course I laughed. She giggled but as we talked it became clear to me that she was, in fact, dead serious. I told her I thought it would be weird if she did that, especially for me as her boyfriend. She seemed really confused by that?? I told her if she won’t change her costume I wouldn’t want to be in pictures with her and she was genuinely hurt and upset. I just don’t know what to do because I already invited her and I really don’t want to hurt her feelings but I don’t think I want to be seen with someone dressed as a sexy baby??

For more context, she has never done anything like that before. We’ve never even done baby voice to each other in private. Now all of a sudden she wants to walk around wearing God knows what (she said lingerie and a diaper) saying “I’m just a baby”?? It just makes me rethink her as a person.

15,2026/2/27,17: 8:59,1qneksg,relationshipadvice,I [34M] have ignored my wife's [34F] emotional needs for 15 years,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationshipadvice/comments/1qneksg/i_34m_have_ignored_my_wifes_34f_emotional_needs/,/r/relationshipadvice/comments/1qneksg/i_34m_have_ignored_my_wifes_34f_emotional_needs/,48,Delusion_Of_Adequacy,40,"I'm a 34 year old Dutch guy. I've been together with my wife (34F) for almost 15 years, we have lived together almost all of that and been married for almost 9 years. We have two children under 6 years old.

I've ""cognitively"" known for a long time that other people have feelings and emotions and those will influence the way they act. However, it wasn't until some time over the past couple weeks or so was that I genuinely ""understood"" what that means, at least in a small part.

This came to be because, when I feel sad/tired/whathaveyou I will sometimes be crabby or otherwise act unpleasantly towards people around me. I then expect those people to understand that I'm just not feeling well in that moment, and expect them to give me space to act like that without judgement. However, I recently realised I do not grant the same liberty to other people, most of all my wife.

This realization came when I was doing something on the floor in the hallway of our house. My 5-year old needed to unpack his school lunch bag, and to do so he had to pass by me, but I effectively blocked the path. He told me to get out of the way, and did so in a bit of an annoyed fashion. I was about to tell him off for talking like that when I caught myself, and realised that he was talking like that because he'd had a long day at school, now had to do a chore he had no interest in doing and on top of that I was blocking his path. In his stead, I would also have been annoyed and short in my way of talking. So instead of telling him off, I just moved over and let him pass.

At that point something ""clicked"" in my mind: I have been expecting other people, my wife most of all, to give me space and understanding, without me ever returning the favour. Although I am still trying to come to grips with this whole thing and the consequences, just logically speaking this must mean I have always neglected my wife's needs and emotions. I know she has often told me I was doing so, but I never really understood why because my answer would usually be something along the lines of ""I'm trying my best and also I always get your drinks for you from the fridge so really I don't understand why you can't see how hard I work"". (Not exactly in those words obviously, but that was mostly the gist of it).

\---

There is a lot more that I couldn't possibly explain in a single post like this, but suffice to say our relationship is not in a good place right now. My wife has effectively lost all hope that I am capable of change, growing or understanding, and frankly I cannot blame her.

This does mean that discussions about this topic are inherently emotional and difficult, and if she gets upset during an emotional discussion (which she should be allowed to do) I have a tendency to panic, shut down, or argue against her emotions. None of those things are helpful.

\---

So really what I am struggling with, and what I could really use some advice for:

\- How can I explore and understand the consequences of my neglecting her over the past decade-and-a-half?

\- How can I learn more about my wife's needs without flooding her with a bunch of questions she most likely won't know the answer to in a bite-sized package?

\- How to have a productive conversation about this without becoming overwhelmed, panicking or arguing?

\- How can I support my wife in dealing with all this?

\- What resources are available for me to learn more about all this?

\---

I'm aware that this is not going to be an overnight fix, and to undo 15 years of damage may very well take another 15 years, but I would still really like to do whatever I can to improve the situation. I just don't really know what.

I am also acutely aware that I cannot change the past, which is one thing, but I'm not really sure what to do to positively affect the future and hopefully heal our relationship.

I hope that’s okay!

My husband \[25M\] and I \[21F\] have been married for 6 months, and in total been together for 3 years. For about 10 or so years my husband has been friends with a woman who lives in the UK (we live in the states). My husband loves to travel and he would often travel with her, her boyfriend if she had one at the time, and sometimes their other friends. This went on before and during our relationship. For health reasons, I have never been able to travel with them. I knew about this friend our entire relationship, but because she lives so far away and I can’t travel, we never got to know one another. I never had much of an opinion of her because of this, but I did often get sad that she got to travel with my husband and have those special memories and I didn’t. I never wanted him to stop traveling with her though and always expressed to him I didn’t want him to stop doing what he loves.

Occasionally, throughout the years he would tell me things this friend said about me. She would hear little bits of a story from my husband and then come up with beliefs about me which weren’t true. My husband would try to correct her but he struggles with confrontation and she wouldn’t back down. One example, is my husband was on a trip with them and he wanted to get spontaneous tattoos with them. He called me and asked me how I’d feel about this. I told I would be sad, but if he wanted to he could and it’s his body he is free to do what he wants with it. Now, the reason I said this was because prior to the trip, my husband and I had a plan that I would design his first tattoo for him (I’m an artist) and I would get to be there for this experience. We were both excited about this. There are a lot of experiences we miss out on together due to my health, so I was excited to have this one together. But if he wanted to get this tattoo with his friend he doesn’t have to ask me for permission or anything like that. It’s his body, not mine. Well, the friend thought that I said he wasn’t allowed to and she called me toxic and controlling. Stuff like this continued to happen throughout our relationship.

In September of last year, my husband wanted me to join a group chat with this friend and her boyfriend. I was excited to get to know them and hopefully befriend them. I tried to befriend her, and at first it seemed like things were going well, but then I started to be excluded. They were all playing this video game together and that’s all they wanted to talk about (I don’t have a PC so I wasn’t able to play) so I started to get left out of the conversations. I also started to notice the way this friend would talk to me one on one about my husband was sort of odd to me. She made a big deal about little acts my husband would do for her on trips and it just seemed a bit odd to me. She considered my husband her guy best friend but my husband never called her that and thought it was odd she called him that. He’s the kind of guy who thinks his SO should be his girl best friend.

Things really blew up when she interjected heavily into a personal issue my husband and I were having. I don’t feel comfortable going into the details because it’s related to an addiction my husband has. She got wind of it and kept telling him how I was handling everything wrong and saying all these things about me being controlling and toxic. My husband asked her stop and said she didn’t understand what was going on, but she wouldn’t stop. I was very hurt by this and felt violated by her. This isn’t the first time she’s interjected, but it was the worst time to me because it was about something so vulnerable like my husband’s addiction.

Months passed, and I wanted to talk to her about all the things she did that hurt me, but the time never felt right. Eventually I wrote out this big long message and sent it to her. I wanted to air everything out and hopefully we could come to an understanding and find peace. I tried to be as respectful as possible, reading over it countless times to make sure it didn’t sound aggressive and making sure to say that I didn’t want to fight or argue but just clear everything up. Her response was very aggressive, she lied about things I said, called me names, and said that my husband was going to come to his senses and leave me. I didn’t attack her back, I knew that wouldn’t help, I only corrected the lies she said about me. She did mention one thing I did that hurt her, it’s a long story, but the gist is I told my husband I wasn’t sure if her and her boyfriend were actually dating because they hid their relationship for so long. I meant it as a joke but it didn’t come across that way and I completely understand how that hurt her. I expressed this to her and apologized for what I said. It was immature of me to say it and I messed up. She never apologized for anything she said about me though which hurt. She just denied everything. He ended up proposing to me that same night, and she was the only one who didn’t congratulate him.

When my husband found out happened, and read both of our sides, he was appalled by what she said. He wanted to call her out for this, but he kept putting it off because he is so non confrontational.

They, meaning the friend and her boyfriend, weren’t invited to the wedding because of everything that has happened at this point. The day after our wedding, they started messaging him very upset they weren’t invited. That’s when my husband stood up for me and called her out for what she said about me. This turned into a week of back and forth texting between him and both of them. They were constantly attacking me saying how horrible I am, and him attempting to defend me but getting so overwhelmed. I was distraught and so depressed. This was supposed to be my honeymoon, we were just married and this friend was making it all about her. She even said that she should come before me in his life because she’s known him longer and we’d “only been married for 5 minutes.” We both got so overwhelmed with everything that he ended up blocking them. He said he finally saw her true colors and it was over. It was such a relief the attacks were finally done. She kept finding ways to reach out but he kept ignoring her, until recently.

His tone as completely changed, he wants me to try and fix things with her, he wants to be friends again, and he agrees with things she’s said about me. He thinks she right about me controlling because I’ve told him I don’t think I can stay in this marriage if she’s back in our lives. I feel blind sided, I’m terrified of her being in our lives again after everything’s she’s done. I understand my husbands been friends with her for so long, I understand he wants to fight for the friendship, but it’s destroying my mental health. I know it’s not fair of me to ask him to not befriend her again, but I’m worried her attacks are too much for me. Every time Ive tried to talk to her she has never taken accountability, I just don’t know want to do. I was willing to work things out with her before, but she’s shown me she won’t take accountability, so it never goes anywhere and I just get bullied.

Any advice would be so appreciated. I don’t know how to get my husband to see her true colors again, I don’t know how to talk to him about this. I’m worried for my marriage. I just don’t know what to do. Please be respectful, it’s been a hard week and Im not in a good place right now.

18,2026/2/27,17: 8:59,1kam21y,relationshipadvice,"I [37F] am buying a house solo, and now my partner [37M], who plans to move in with me, is being weird about paying me rent because he would be “subsidizing my asset and getting nothing back.”",https://www.reddit.com/r/relationshipadvice/comments/1kam21y/i_37f_am_buying_a_house_solo_and_now_my_partner/,/r/relationshipadvice/comments/1kam21y/i_37f_am_buying_a_house_solo_and_now_my_partner/,44,Exotic-Bathroom4875,129,"As the title says, I (37F) am about to buy a house. Currently my partner (37M) and I live in a rental flat which is in his name. We have to move out of the flat this summer because his landlord is selling. So I had to find somewhere for us to live, and buying offered more security than renting - plus, finding a rental where we live is even harder than buying. 

My partner is being very weird about my house purchase, however. We can’t both be on the mortgage right now because he’s still mired in a highly litigious assets dispute with his previous partner, and in any case, I preferred to buy by myself at this stage because we haven’t been together long. All along, he objected to me buying and preferred that we find another rental. However, he wasn’t willing to put any effort toward finding a rental, and I wanted a more permanent solution because I am having a baby in September (and because the rental market is absolutely insane where we live, as in people overbidding for rent and taking places without even viewing them). So I found a house to buy and am arranging a mortgage right now. 

Now, he’s being awkward about paying me “rent” for his half of expenses and the mortgage. He feels that doing so is effectively subsidizing my mortgage and allowing me to acquire an asset, while he gets nothing. I do see his point: if we were married, he’d be entitled to a portion of the house’s value, but because we aren’t and he isn’t on the mortgage, he doesn’t get anything. He has proposed that I reimburse him for at least part of his contribution in the event that we don’t stay together, which is somewhat akin to being bought out of the mortgage if we were married and then got divorced. 

I said that this proposal is not okay for me because a) it would be financially ruinous for me to have to pay him back money that he paid me, for example if we were to separate 3 years down the line. I’d face losing the house. I checked and I am under absolutely no legal obligation to compensate him for his contribution because the house is in my name only, so it seems stupid for me to agree voluntarily to something like this. I would rather just not accept any of his money than have it be essentially a possible “loan.” 

And b) we aren’t married, so I don’t see why he should expect to have any right to my assets as if we were. It is possible for me to add my partner to the mortgage later, for example if we do decide to get married. I checked with my bank. Then it would be different - we’d have committed to one another and be mutually obligated to one another financially in a way we aren’t now (although the baby obviously creates some durable financial ties…). 

We did discuss some sort of rebate percentage, such as 33% of his contribution in the event we split up. This is financially doable for me, if annoying. But I can’t help but feel that it doesn’t make sense. He wasn’t planning to buy his own property for another few years anyways, and he’ll be paying a lot less for his share of expenses with me than he would be on his own. I am willing to put him on the mortgage down the line, if the relationship lasts… but these sorts of conversations make me think it probably won’t!!

To be clear, I have told him he isn’t obliged to pay anything. The mortgage is in my name only and I didn’t take on more debt than I could handle myself. We earn roughly the same amount of money (he earns more but has to pay child support, so our disposable income is similar), and we currently split rent and bills. He can opt out and go live on his own, which of course would be more expensive for both of us, but I’m not forcing anything on him. He feels that an arrangement of him paying me rent and thus “subsiding my mortgage” would be unfair, so I need a reality check from strangers on the internet because part of me can see his point, even if I think he’s wrong. 

So, Reddit, how should we navigate this situation? Thanks in advance for reading and for your input!

Back in 2023, I met “Devin” \\\[25M\\\] on a gaming server. We spoke almost daily except for the two times he ghosted me for multiple months. After both times, he apologized and told me he thought of me everyday. He revealed to me that he ghosted me the first time due to server drama (he left the server entirely) and he ghosted me the second time because a mutual friend of ours revealed that I had feelings for Devin and he felt that our friendship was over. While he admitted this to me, I didn’t feel comfortable having this conversation yet. 1. I did not confess my feelings personally because we have not met in person. I wanted to meet in person (something we discussed and planned) first and make sure I still had feelings. Honestly, I was very hurt and upset that someone made this confession for me. 2. Since I had just been ghosted for months I did not currently have feelings for him. He told me that we’d address the matter later. This was in September 2024. Fast forward to July 2025, we still hadn’t talked about it. However, my feelings for Devin had returned so I asked him to clarify the boundaries of our relationship. Even if he didn’t return my feelings, I wanted to find a way to stay friends. To my surprise, he confessed that he had feelings for me as well. We decided to wait to make it official until we met in person. We agreed that I would visit him in December after Christmas. To tell the truth, our dynamic shifted very quickly. Technically, we weren’t dating, but the way we spoke and acted felt very romantic. This became very difficult because of the distance. We wanted to progress our relationship but we had to wait until December. In September he decided that we should slow down. As if nothing happened, we went back to how things were before we confessed. This was very jarring for me and left me feeling unstable in our relationship. However, I decided to be patient and carry on as normal. Come October, he texts me asking for space due to mental health issues. I offered him support and I told him I’d be waiting. I expected him to reach out after a week or two but a month passes without a word. In late November he texts me letting me know that he is still having a hard time but he’s hoping to be around early December. It is now January and I’ve heard nothing else from him. I texted him once wishing him a Merry Christmas and he didn’t even read the message. A part of me is afraid that calling or texting him would upset him. I respect his wishes, but I want to understand where we stand. This amount of distance in a budding relationship is feeling like a warning sign.   

Some important information: I am actively in therapy. I was diagnosed with BPD earlier this year. For those who do not know much about that, abandonment is very difficult for me. He is aware of this diagnosis and researched it when I told him. I’m trying to be supportive and respond rationally but this feels unfair to me. My emotions have been all over the place and my mind is left to wonder. Waiting for someone is starting to feel overly romanticized. I don’t want things to end between us, but being left in the dark like this hurts. I also feel humiliated because anyone who knows about this thinks I should just block him and move on. My therapist just emailed me explaining that she has a family emergency and she is also unsure of when she will return. My circle is very small and I feel so alone. Any advice or suggestion is welcome. ",1767510444.0,,False,False,True,N/A,,False,False,False,False,False,0.78,N/A
20,2026/2/27,17: 8:59,1k27p0a,relationshipadvice,My gf [22F] and my best friend [23M] are trying to push a threesome on me [22M].,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationshipadvice/comments/1k27p0a/my_gf_22f_and_my_best_friend_23m_are_trying_to/,/r/relationshipadvice/comments/1k27p0a/my_gf_22f_and_my_best_friend_23m_are_trying_to/,42,Middle_Strawberry808,88,"I (22M) am dating (22F) Sarah for about a year now, we met 3 months before dating, I had to convince her to date me as I'm not typically her ""type"". I'm quite a small man, 5,2 to be exact and pretty feminine, she normally goes for the more masculine looking guys but she decided to give me a chance anyways. 

We have been in a great loving relationship so far, and I truly don't know why she feels the need to bring this up... A couple months ago, she started asking me about my thoughts on threesomes and my sexuality, I've never really cared for the idea of threesomes personally and I am confident in my straight identity, I kinda thought her questions were weird, especially since she didn't seem happy with my answers, but I brushed it off.

Four nights ago, she sat me down and asked for a threesome, I told her I didn't like the idea of it but I suppose I could do it if she really wants. She said that she would love to do one and asked if I had someone in mind, I obviously said no, as I had never thought about this kind of thing, and she said she already had someone in mind but didn't want to tell me until she knew he would be on board. I thought this was fishy but I let it go.

Last night, she was over at my house which I share with my roomate (23M), Let's call him Sam (We're all uni students btw). Me and her were watching a movie together when she went to the bathroom, she was gone for a while and when she came back Sam was with her too. They sat me down and Sarah started saying that Sam was the person she had I'm mind and Sam was on board.

I have known Sam for 3 years, we originally hated one another but we became friends 2 years ago and roomates for 1 and a half years. Sam is the opposite of me, I'm 5,2 and feminine while he is 6,5 and very masculine, definitely a 10/10 on the attractiveness scale, he is also my best friend and I definitely don't want to fuck him... 

Sam and Sarah sat me down and are very adamant and pushy about the threesome, I told them in no uncertain terms, no. They let it go but they didn't seem happy with my answer, I'm afraid they will bring it up again and I don't know what to do. 

I'm also concerned about why Sarah chose him, my best friend, even more so concerned with why Sam agreed, especially when he has always hated her and has tried to get me to leave her multiple times.

I don't know why I'm posting here, maybe just to get it off my mind, maybe to ask how I get them to drop this. I love my girlfriend and my best friend and I don't want to loose either of them.

Update:

So... Against my better judgement and everyone's advice, two nights ago, I went through with the threesome with my GF Sarah and my bestfriend Sam...

Before we had the threesome I sat Sarah down as per people's advice and asked her why Sam, she said she thought he would be a safe bet as he's done threesomes before and he's bisexual (though she's ignoring the fact I'm straight with this). Then I asked her if she thought I was gay, and maybe that's why she wants this, she said that while I am quite feminine and she originally thought I was gay, she says she now knows I'm not (and has known since we started dating) but this is an experience she's always wanted to try out. 
I also asked if she would be willing to try a threesome with another woman, (even though that is something I also don't want) and she got pissed, saying she was straight and how could I suggest something that gross, which I think is INCREDIBLY hypocritical of her but whatever...

I didn't want to lose her... I had put so much into this relationship, and I felt pressured by her. I figured that since I loved her so much, I could try this, this one thing, this one hail mary. I figured if this didn't work (like I thought it wouldnt) then that was us done. I figured since we had been together this long, I could at least try it, one last effort.

It's safe to say the threesome didn't go well... But, not for the reasons I thought... Two nights ago, we did the threesome in Sam's room (I didn't want to do it in mine), and it was actually good. I was surprised and thought it was a good experience and hoped we could move on and forget abt it, but Sarah wasn't happy with how the threesome went... 

Last night, we were lying in bed next to one another at mine. When she brought up the threesome, she said she was unhappy as apparently me and Sam ended up pushing her to the side... I honestly didn't realise, but looking back on it now, I suppose it wasn't much of a threesome after all... She started yelling at me for ""being gay"" and ""being in love with my best friend"" (which isn't true at all). Started saying shit like ""you never were that passionate with me"", ""I've never heard you make those noises"", and then the cherry on top, ""Sam didn't even touch me"".

I asked her more on that last one and after some probing, she admitted she had the hots for Sam since she met him, that she felt disappointed that she got with me first and didn't have a chance with him, that was until her girlfriend suggested asking me for a threesome with Sam, so that she could have a chance to fuck away her crush on a non committal man while not cheating on me who is ""stable and reliable"". Which is just fucking great to hear your girlfriend tell you....

I just kinda shut down after she said that, which made her more mad, she ended up storming out of my house and called me the F-slur...

Sam heard everything and came out of his room as she was leaving, ended up yelling a fuck you b as she slammed the door which was admittedly kinda funny. He asked if I was alright and made me a hot chocolate while I sat on the couch. We ended up talking throughout the night, about nothing important, dodging what just happened as I didn't want to talk about it. We ended up cuddling and falling asleep together on the couch which was weird but whatever. 

Me and my gf still aren't talking and for some reason Sam's being way more touchy then normal lately, idk why but my best guess is pity, which isn't great...

Idk how the situation got to this, first, she want a threesome with my bestfriend just to fuck him, practically begs me, then when I go through with it for her she gets pissed that Sam didn't give her the light of day and mad with me for going with it.",1744990119.0,,1745320434.0,False,True,N/A,,False,False,False,False,False,0.86,N/A

We have gotten through a lot of it but there’s still an issue on his end with consistency and just basic human respect and communication. Recently he has been on this kick of wanting to try for a baby. Now we do live together have been since we started dating (I know not a smart idea I realize now) but I’m not ready for a child right now. We constantly fight and it’s not a normal couple fight it gets BAD. The verbal things are just bad I mean the things he says sometimes you just don’t say to some you “love.” I have tried for 4 years to get him to change his ways I have spoken to him MULTIPLE times on what needs to change and that I’m sick of the constant insults and no help. He doesn’t want to change clearly but he is pressuring me and putting me into a weird situation of wanting to try for a baby and I’m not comfortable with it. I have a GYNO appointment coming soon but I think I might call them and explain the situation and get on birth control secretly. He wants to come with me to the appointment but I know if I call and tell them to keep him away they will. I’m just terrified of how this is all going to play out. I don’t know what to do about my relationship. He tells me if I don’t have a baby soon he will kick me out and I have nowhere to go if that happens. I don’t have a job either which is a big issue and he ran me into serious debt issues so. PLEASE any advice I need. I also want to point out I am very aware that I contributed to part of my issue by not leaving sooner but trust me when I say I have tried before he makes it impossible to leave.

We live in a 2 bedroom house. The extra room used to be his gaming room. It’s not decorated or anything. It’s just a room he likes to game and watch YouTube. We have lived together for close to a decade and he has almost always had his own space to game.

I’m not big on decorating but I wanted to make sure that we had the necessities (crib, changing table, rocking chair). This stuff is in the nursery while his gaming desk and PC takes up the other half of the room. It’s a small room.

I have brought up several times that we should move his PC to the living room so I can start bedtime routines with her. He gets irritated and doesn’t want to talk about it further. I’ve tried bringing it up when we are already talking about serious topics or when he is in a good mood. It’s not like I bring it up during an argument. He basically blows it off and then he’s not in a good mood for a while. It’s frustrating because I haven’t been able to start a routine yet due to him being in there gaming or watching YouTube until late.

He has said that if the PC is in the living room, then it will interfere with me watching tv in there. I’m only in there watching tv when I’m nursing. When trying to offer solutions for keeping the PC in the nursery, he’s  offered to put his headphones on so that there is no noise to distract her. But she’s already distracted by his bright PC playing in the room. I mean of course she’d rather stare at a colorful screen than read a book or fall asleep.

She only wants to fall asleep while nursing on me and if I can associate sleep with a bedtime routine, I can try to ween her out of that habit. He doesn’t help with bedtime or nights so I don’t think he understands how important it is for baby to start learning how to fall asleep on her own. I also want her to have her own clean space since we have 3 dogs. They either get in the way or it’s not always the cleanest outside her nursery. Why do you think he is not wanting to take his PC out of the nursery?

Quick side note: we planned to have a baby. She wasn’t a surprise. We talked about it for a couple years and constantly the months leading up to trying. He begged me for a traditional life where he worked and I quit my job. Since the baby has been born, he says we should have waited.

Title says it: I [30M] am worried my wife [27F] is eating herself into an early grave.

She has always had a binging habit that stemmed from childhood abuse (she told me this outright), but she has always wanted to improve herself and break this bad habit. I have had my share of poor eating habits so I understand how difficult it can be, but mine stems from just attitude toward eating and not anything deeply scarring so I can only imagine the additional difficulties that she deals with.

We both have been trying to improve our health for about a few years now, and there have been small successes: better foods in the pantry, walking more when weather permits, trying to eat out less often. I see every step forward as a success.

As of half a year ago, though, things have been regressing significantly on her end. She was diagnosed with type 2 diabetes (post gestational diabetes) and has taken to ordering takeout daily with cookies, fried foods, sugary snacks: essentially everything that would make diabetes worse. Personally, I keep making my healthy meals and invite her to join in by saying I'll cook for the both of us, but she'll have none of it and want to order out for the largest portions of takeout she can find for dinner while also ordering out for breakfast most days for things that would also make her diabetes worse. She has not been doing any testing of her blood sugars, not even in the morning, despite reminders and reassurances that it's only to make sure she's doing well.

It's distressing since I saw my mother do the same thing and destroy her health to the point of needing fistfuls of pills and insulin after meals in order to not go to the hospital for hyperglycemia. I am prediabetic myself so even the implication that I could turn out that way terrifies me and keeps me motivated to stick to what I need to do to control my situation. Seeing another loved one makes me feel like I'm spiraling into becoming a widowed husband and it's all my fault.

The breaking point for me was when she had us drive an hour out at bight to order from a specific restaurant that sells exclusively deep fried food after we went to two separate grocery stores and I ran through all the options I had to cook at home. Our kid [7 month old]  was crying and screaming about 3/4 the way through the trip there despite all best efforts of calming him down (feeding, changing diaper, toys, etc.) so it added a lot to the stress of the situation.

I know the abuse cuts deep for my wife and constant reassurances that it was not her fault and recommendations to therapy do not seem to move things in a better direction. Has anyone had any success in making this kind of situation better? I feel like trying to be less enabling is the first step, but I am not sure how to do this without making her cry (which unfortunately tends to be her reaction to any pushback) and regress further. Note that she can still very much keep ordering the unhealthy foods on her own because of DoorDash.

Lastly: please don't advise me to divorce her. I love her deeply and I just want her to get better. I plan on being with her until the end, no matter what, but I want her time to be filled with healthy years, not having her body barely scrape by until it gives out. While it's a secondary concern, it's also a financial worry since money is already tight and we have a child to feed. Apologies if my wording might make me sound cruel, I just want my wife to get better.

I explained that those jokes aren’t funny to me and that pregnancy is a serious thing, not something to joke about or force on someone. He says I’m overreacting and that he’s “just joking,” but it keeps happening.
Now I’m feeling uneasy about having sex with him because I don’t fully trust that he respects my boundaries or my choices about my own body. I don’t know if this is something people would consider a red flag or if I’m reading too much into it.

My wife has entered a new job and this random dude instantly started hitting on her, (kept inviting her out for dinners after work without the other colleagues, giving gifts, concerts, going out of his way to talk non stop to her even after work, despite knowing her for like 5 days) 

She sees him as just being a good friend, but it is obvious to me what this guys intentions are. 

This has started countless discussions where I tell her that I am not comfortable with letting him do these things, and that despite me trusting that she wouldn't be unfaithful, I still  do not like that this guy is showing disrespect to our relationship like that. 

My wife kept telling me that since she wouldn't do anything with him that I shouldn't be jealous and just let it be. 
She doesn't understand that to me this isn't about jealousy but my anger at this guy for not showing our relationship any respect. 

I know that pushing this issue could ruin my relationship, since from her perspective you cannot be in a relationship with someone who doesn't trust you, and I agree. 
But in this case i should just let this guy shit all over the relationship, it makes no sense. 

I feel like I am in a catch 22 where nothing I do is the right decision. 

I feel like my feelings should matter too despite her not seeing the logic.

We got together right before COVID, quarantined together, and things got serious fast. Over time, I became the one who handles basically everything — cleaning, dishes, cooking, grocery planning, and managing the household. At first I didn’t mind, but now I resent it.

The bigger issue is his complete lack of motivation and independence.

We’ve both lost jobs before. When I lose a job, I treat finding a new one like a full-time job. I spend hours every day applying, interviewing, and doing whatever I need to do to get back on my feet. When he loses a job, he applies to maybe one or two places every couple of weeks and then just waits and hopes for the best.

Right now, he hasn’t worked since July 2025. His unemployment has run out. I’m working two jobs to keep everything afloat while he stays home playing video games most of the day.

He wasn’t applying seriously, so I ended up logging into his accounts and applying for jobs for him myself. Now he has interviews and potential offers, but I still have to tell him exactly what to say in responses. He makes careless mistakes like signing the wrong name on emails. It makes me feel like I’m managing a child instead of being in a relationship with an adult.

I still have to argue with him to do basic chores, even though he’s home all day. I’ll come home exhausted and nothing is done. When I bring it up, I’m told I’m nagging.

What really hurt was my 30th birthday and our 6-year anniversary this year. He got me nothing. Not even something small. Meanwhile, he still buys himself Dunkin’, takeout, and new clothes. It made me feel like I wasn’t worth any effort.

Another layer to this is financial stress. We both have debt. I actually have more debt than he does because of bad decisions I made when I was younger, and I fully take responsibility for that. I pay all of my own bills and never expect him to fix my mistakes. But the reality is, I’m still the one working two jobs, carrying the financial load, and holding everything together.

I don’t feel like I have a partner I can rely on. I feel like I have someone who relies on me.

It’s a heavy feeling knowing that if something went wrong in my life, I don’t feel confident he could help me. Meanwhile, I’m expected to help him constantly. It makes me feel like the weight of everything is on my shoulders, and I don’t have anyone to lean on.

This has affected how I see him. We barely have sex anymore because I’m so resentful and emotionally disconnected. It’s hard to feel attracted to someone when you feel like their parent.

Communication is also terrible. Anytime I try to talk about my feelings or our future, he shuts down, says he’s uncomfortable, and walks away . Nothing ever gets resolved.

I’ve been very clear that I want marriage and kids. I always hoped to be on that path by 30. I’m 30 now. After more than 6 years together and 5 years living together, there’s no ring, no timeline, and he won’t even seriously talk about it.

I love him, but I’m exhausted. I feel like I financially support him, mentally manage his life, manage the household, and carry the emotional burden of the relationship.

I’ve been trying to prep our home to make things more accessible and clean in preparation (i.e. meal prepping and freezing food so we’d have stuff on hand).

My husband has been depressed for the greater portion of this year. The depression was only exasperated once the pain became difficult. My partner has loosely suggested that if things don’t improve by summer next year, they’ll escalate things.

We’re both still relatively young so my husband’s mother came to stay with us for the weekend following the surgery. (I have a great relationship with her and we get along really well.) It’s important to note that my husband loves his mother (and father!) and is very family oriented. We see them a handful of times a year but don’t live close to them.

For the first time in months, my husband has been animated and warm again. He’s been affectionate (asking for hugs and kisses, which he hasn’t done much lately), wanting to do activities together, holding my hand out of the blue. I was shocked, but relieved, hoping the looming surgery was changing the way he acts towards me. My husband hasn’t been talking to me much before.

Our relationship is in a difficult spot. I think he’s unintentionally being manipulative at times and has a really hard time apologizing (he’ll say: I’m sorry you took it that way, or something similar). He’s stressed most of the time and snaps at me pretty frequently. Our dog we have together gets excited to see him and barks and he’s been annoyed with that, pushing him off and being irritated with him. I pack him lunch daily and usually draw a picture and write a little note and when I ask him about it, he’ll say he didn’t look at it. I’m trying pretty hard, but things are in a tough spot. To be honest, our moments of joy together are pretty far and few. To say I was excited to finally connect to my partner again was an understatement. I really miss him and I connecting.

The day of the surgery my husband and I were alone getting ready to leave. He needed some paperwork sorted out and asked me to take care of it and I responded by saying of course, and we should ask together at check in. (I had been asking the week leading up if there was paperwork or phone calls I could help with. Until the morning of surgery, he said no.)

He immediately went rigid and cold. He started to say that I never help him with anything and that he can’t trust me to take care of simple things. I immediately apologized and said I could take care of it by myself and I tried to hug him. He didn’t want to touch, and said that he couldn’t believe that I wouldn’t help him. I told him that I think there was a misunderstanding and I wanted to help him. I was on the verge of tears at this point - his surgery was in less than an hour and I didn’t want to argue. I desperately wanted to connected with him. I was nervous for his surgery and wanted him emotionally close. My husband left the bathroom without a resolution despite my begging him to stay and work things out.

For context, I do all the cooking in the house because he doesn’t like to. I do the grocery shopping 85% of the time, even before the pain started up. I’m the sole caretaker of our dog. I book all of his Dr appointments and even was the one to keep calling to get his surgery scheduled. I carry a huge load and make sure things keep running. I know he’s depressed - I’ve just also been stretched pretty thin.

My husband barely talked to me on the drive to the surgery center. I tried to reach over to hold his hand twice but each time he just glared at me and said what. We were in the car with his mom so I didn’t press it. His sour mood continued until he was wheeled away for surgery. I was terrified our last interaction was going to be him mad at me over paperwork. (I did end up sorting the paperwork out while he was under.)

Thankfully my husband’s surgery went well. We get his meds on the way home and I remind him he needs food to take his pain meds. I ask him what he wants to eat, he says I don’t know, so I say I can choose. I chose one of the five meals I prepped and froze. He said he won’t eat that because he’s about to be eating a lot of those meals. He hadn’t eaten them yet and they were each different meals (breakfast burritos, curries, casseroles). I made them as backup because I didn’t think I was going to be up for cooking after a chaotic day.

Since he rejected what I chose, I asked what he wanted instead. He said he wouldn’t eat the prepped meals and wouldn’t choose. I said I could cook something different. At this point he’s pretty upset and says he won’t eat anything. All the while his mom is in the car with us. My husband is being pretty short and snappy with me again.

His mom eventually solved the problem by getting fast food after we got home. His mom comforted me and said she knows I’m trying my best to support him.

My husband eventually cools. We spent the weekend relaxing and lounging around. Again, he’s being affectionate with me for the first time in so long.

It’s finally time to say goodbye to his mom and the second she leaves, it’s over. My husband stops talking to me. I ask what he wants to do and he responded with I don’t know or snaps at me. I was drawing next to him while he rested his eyes on the couch and he gets up abruptly. I ask him where he’s going and he just says “somewhere.” I follow him, and goes to lay down.

I ask him if somethings the matter as there’s been a sharp difference in the way he treated in the hour since his mother left.

He said that all I did this weekend was make everything about me and cited the pre surgery incident and me not knowing what he wanted to eat. I was floored. I spent hours prepping, scheduling, and attempting to connect. We played games he wanted for literal hours for two days straight. I took the entire next week of work off. I’ve been caretaking for him.

This sharp and drastic change after I thought things were starting to change has me feeling genuine despair. I’m starting to think I might be in a manipulative or emotionally abusive relationship. I’ve bent over backwards for him this week and weekend.

In the weeks leading up to the surgery, my husband ended with me (took off his rings and everything) when I held firm that I wanted an apology when he spilled something on a blanket of mine and said it didn’t matter because our dog might ruin the blanket anyways. Things escalated to an argument and that’s when he did it. When he realized what he’d done and said he didn’t want to end things anymore, he said it would be me deciding to ends things with him if I didn’t want him. He’s maintained since that argument that I was actually the one who ended things with him which didn’t happen. I almost feel like I’m losing myself and my sense of understanding on what happens between us. In his retelling, he’s never done anything wrong and he doesn’t apologize. If I ever make a mistake even after apologizing and after literal years pass between the event and now, he’ll still bring things up and throw it in my face when we argue.

My husband doesn’t eat if I don’t feed him. He won’t cook for us. He doesn’t take care of our dog. He doesn’t thank me for all of the work I put in.

We’ve been in couples therapy for a month. I asked him to schedule it but he never did so I’m paying for it solely out of pocket. I recently signed him up for therapy and he’s been going for a few weeks. I had asked him to do that himself but I had to call and schedule for him. I go to therapy myself.

In situations like these, do things ever get better? I love my husband with everything I have but I feel like I’m losing myself. All I want is to be respected, seen, and appreciated. The way he talks to me sometimes is chilling. I know that he’s very depressed and I am trying to be understanding. I’m doing a lot. I don’t want to end things, but things are starting to feel really uncomfortable to me. Sometimes when I cry he mocks me and says that now he’s supposed to be nice to me because I can’t handle anything. It hurts.

I don’t know. I appreciate the space to get this out there. Any advice is appreciated. I really want to stay together and really want to make things work. I feel so hopeless but I know I’m in the thick of it and might not be seeing as clearly as I’d like.",1760343405.0,,False,False,True,N/A,,False,False,False,False,False,0.97,N/A

We've been together for about 3 years now, and the last year and a half she's been neglecting her hygiene. --

Important information: My fiance struggles heavily with mental health issues, and has her whole life. But after a terrible car accident and the death of a family member, she's never been the same in terms of taking care of herself. 

I really try to be supportive, as any partner should be, but it has gotten to a point where I physically cannot be inimate with her. I love her deeply, but without my intervention, she won't shower for around 2 weeks straight, unless she has something important going on. She won't change her underwear for the same length of time, even if she's bled in them. She won't wash her face or take care of her teeth properly. On top of it, she works in a car-part warehouse and gets sweaty and greasy throughout the day. I've had several conversations with her, some constructive and polite and some fed up and argumentative. Her excuse is that she can't stand being cold (before getting in the shower, and after getting out), but I turn the heat up for her, I put her change of clothes and towel in the dryer for her so it's warm when she gets out... I try everything to make it a pleasant experience for her, yet she still won't do it. 

It's really starting to get to the point where I feel like a parent trying to get their toddler in the bathtub. I have to police everything and make sure she takes care of herself. But even so she'll say ""Can I shower tomorrow? I promise I will!"" And then won't. I really don't know how else to handle this situation and everything I come up with is just threats to the relationship, which is toxic and I don't want to do that. I mean, she's turning 30 this year and I have to beg her to shower. Any advice is helpful. Thank you!",1768385154.0,,False,False,True,N/A,,False,False,False,False,False,0.91,N/A

For a while I was acting quite out of character, I guess that’s my nervous system dysregulated. I guess our relationship wasn’t considered ‘toxic’ but narcissistic abuse. 

I reread my previous post which was removed shortly after posting, I’m not sure why- but i really was thankful for all the comments and support I got. That was a real human out there somewhere, giving me unbiased opinion while I begged for someone to hear me. It’s what I needed in that godforsaken lonely town. I revisited the comments on the post. People who had experience with liars like the one I married, girls my age who weren’t married but could see I needed to have some self respect. I had them all screenshotted at the time and every comment i tried to wrap my head around the fact I did indeed need to get out. 

I moved back home, back across the country to the life I had before I was isolated as a stranded stay at home, with no hobbies of her own. Now, I have a great job, my own car, a cat who I come home to. Peace. 

Anyways, my point is thanks. I needed someone to tell me I wasn’t crazy and to get up. If you’re in a relationship where you go to bed and your heart is heavy, you’re consumed by the every comment, movement of a man. If you’re questioning whether it’s worth it to face the immediate pain of leaving for the gain of yourself, the peace you need- the time will come when you work up the courage, and you will be so proud of yourself for putting you first. I still struggle, I’m by no means healed, but good things take time. YOU are worth it. Put you first. No relationship is worth questioning your worth. ❤️‍🩹

If you’ve made it this far, thanks. I don’t usually post, but I love watching the communities on here. Thanks again yall.",1757986013.0,,False,False,True,N/A,,False,False,False,False,False,1.0,N/A

I have been dating my partner for about six years now. We have had some rocky times, got our act together a little back in 2024. Since then, everything has been much better. The communication has been stellar. The listening and taking each other’s words into consideration have been better than they ever were (for most everything). I can say I am happy with everything in this man except for one thing: he refuses to believe I am happy or sexually pleased with him.

This has been a battle ever since the relationship started. Nothing I say, do, or reassure him with helps him in any way. For reference, my boyfriend is average sized. This, of course, is no issue to me. I’m not sure why it would be. I think my partner feels absolutely phenomenal. He makes me feel good, knows how to work me, and is able to finish me almost every single time. I enjoy sex with my partner, and I wouldn’t change anything.

However, even knowing all of this, my boyfriend refuses to believe that I am sexually satisfied. It is not uncommon for us to have several hour long conversations with him practically in tears about this. Many times, I am on the verge of crying and yelling because I am so frustrated with this. I am honestly at a breaking point. I don’t really know who to turn to for advice, and this is really my last ditch attempt for some sort of advice. I love this man with all my heart, but he doesn’t seem to believe that I do.

These insecurities are starting to get to a point where they are driving me away. It almost feels like a slap in the face when I tell my lover that I love him with all my heart, only to be told that he doesn’t believe me. Or for me to say sex feels good but then he turns around and accuses me of lying about it. That there is no way I could possibly love him. And then queue the list of reasons why I couldn’t possibly love him. I really don’t know what to do anymore.",1772004485.0,,False,False,True,N/A,,False,True,False,False,False,0.97,N/A

I met a girl I used to know, whose  now single with a kid , stay at home mom.

When we are together we have a good time and she's very affectionate but she never , ever shuts up. I've got used to living alone in the quiet for 2 years.

From the moment she wakes , she is on broadcast, every thought she has she verbalises . Not even necessarily talking to me, if I pretend to be asleep she talks to herself or monologues at full conversation volume . 
If I try and have a conversation with her she will routinely talk over me. I try pausing (mistake she just carries on indefinitely) , I try carrying on (she talks over , not even on the same topic often , just whatever thought pops in), if I say ""honey I was talking and you interrupted"" she looks mortified for 10 seconds then starts back up .

What's worse , because she's a stay at home mom who doesn't drive she goes nowhere and does nothing when we are apart. 
I do a 60 hour work week, see friends , go out , do hobbies . 
She is home alone with a 1 year old (I do care for him but we're only 2 months in ).
I get she wants to talk because she's had no one to talk to . But essentially nothing new at all has happened in her life for the last 5 years, which means , when she rambles endlessly it's the same 3 anecdotes, or steam of consciousness

Example from this morning as I pretended to use the bathroom to escape
""I'm gonna make some eggs , no bacon , no eggs , these socks are so comfortable, the baby looks good in green today , I'll make coffee he likes the smell of that , though I like tea , no I'll make tea , that window needs cleaning , I should call my mum , I might call her , no let's call dad instead , my phone's around here somewhere "" no pauses , no audience . Just loud 

On one occasion where I couldn't cope i've literally, very overtly put on noise cancelling headphones with thunderstorms at full volume. 
She sees me do it .
Her lips are still going a mile a minute. 

Does anyone know how to stop her ? I don't want to hurt her . ",1755681267.0,,False,False,True,N/A,,False,False,False,False,False,0.9,N/A

Husband: Haha yeah I've never cheated but if i were traveling I bet I would. My wife would probably even forgive me for it. Did your wife ever find out?

Husbands male collegue: Never

Husband: It's better that way



When I confronted my husband about his line crossing and eventual cheating (virtually/cyber idk what you call it seeking out women on dating apps when married) he didn't think what he was doing was that big deal at all. Over the next day he of course changed his tune. He is so sorry etc, all the typical things someone does after denying and minimizing the pain they have caused. 

  
I'm rambling but my point is this text was sent before he took multiple solo trips and is adamant he has never physically cheated.

I’ve heard of her before, he’s mentioned that they work closely together and message regularly. He’s told me they have a friendly relationship at work though I don’t know her personally.

Here’s what the message said:

“I miss having you in the office \[his name\], it’s not the same.”

After seeing this, I got suspicious and looked through his phone (I know, not right but I did it).  There were other messages between them while he’s been on holiday with me – mostly sharing photos, comments on those photos, jokes.

However, four days earlier, she had sent this:

“Tomorrow I’m swimming! I’m leaving for now. Off to yoga. Miss you. Take care of yourself and \[my name\]. ❤️❤️❤️❤️”

There was also a message from her from before we went on holiday that reads “Have so much fun away and PLEASE send me photos and videos! I’ll miss you heaps!!!”

I brought it up with him, and he said she’s just “very friendly and bubbly like that with everyone” and that “there’s nothing personal or special in those messages.”

I don’t know if I buy this explanation, but I’m I just overreacting? Are messages ok because it’s “just her personality”?

We are deeply incompatible. Our energies clash, and I feel like I’ve become the worst version of myself in this marriage.

My husband constantly gives “feedback” about me — how I need to improve, what I’m doing wrong, how I should grow. He openly compares me to his last gf and tells me I have “a million things to work on.” He frames all of this as concern for my growth, but the reality is I feel small, inadequate, and emotionally drained around him. I know I have my issues. I swing between emotional extremes in relationships, I am egoistic, I’m impulsive and I say awful things when I’m angry. But I’ve never been this bitter or negative in my life.

I recently started reading about emotional dysregulation and ADHD and a lot of it resonates.. impulsivity, intense reactions, low distress tolerance. That said, I keep wondering:

Why does growth have to feel like constant mental warfare with someone I don’t even like anymore?

Some people say partners who trigger you help you grow. But why does that growth come with daily discomfort, criticism, and guilt?

About work and the move to a new country -

I had a decent job and had always wanted a career break. I didn’t quit because I couldn’t cope — I timed my break around when he wanted to move countries. It felt like a practical decision at the time.

Now, however, that break is constantly used (implicitly and explicitly) to load expectations onto me.

Since we moved:

1. All responsibility for setting up the house, buying furniture, exploring the city, and “being productive” has fallen on me.

2. He does nothing in household chores.

3. He expects me to manage the house, keep him accountable, apply for jobs, go to the gym, read books, and constantly self-improve.

Ironically, he himself had a year-long career break in the past and didn’t take on household responsibilities then. If I rest or don’t “do enough,” I’m made to feel guilt, yet his effort is rarely questioned as he is multi tasking since he has multiple sources of income.

Our sleep schedules are opposite. I sleep at 10 pm; he sleeps at 3–4 am. Sometimes when I wake up around 2 am and check on him (mostly out of anxiety), he turns it around and says something I did is why he slept late. That’s usually when I lose my patience.

He snores very loudly, and my sleep has been wrecked this year. He doesn’t feel guilty about it, and the chronic sleep deprivation has made everything worse.

I also cannot tolerate:

1. Him speaking badly about my family

2. Being blamed for his moods

3. Being mocked or guilt-tripped after I react emotionally

Sometimes I want to be affectionate with him, but those moments usually come after I’ve been made to feel guilty for my behavior — which doesn’t feel healthy.

I’ve shared parts of this with my mom, but I hesitate to tell her the worst of it because I don’t want my husband painted as a villain. At the same time, I feel extremely alone.

My questions for those who’ve been in similar situations:

1.	For people who struggle with emotional dysregulation or ADHD traits — what has actually helped you pause or regulate before reacting, especially in close relationships?

2.	How have you learned to disengage from criticism or guilt-tripping from a partner without escalating conflict?

3.	If you’ve dealt with chronic sleep disruption due to a partner’s snoring, what practical solutions worked for you long-term?

4.	Has anyone taken intentional time apart from their spouse to reset emotionally? If so, how did you decide whether it helped or just delayed bigger issues",1768181073.0,,False,False,True,N/A,,False,False,False,False,False,0.96,N/A

Me and my boyfriend have been together five years. The last year and a half, he has studied abroad and we’ve been on a long distance relationship which has been taxing for the relationship as my bf isn’t the best at keeping conversation.

Recently, we travelled abroad together and were taking the metro to the apartment. I’m usually the one planning and paying for most things on our trips, so the weight of keeping everything together and going after schedule falls on me, which sometimes makes me a bit stressed. I am a fast walker and tend to move quickly, as well.

In the metro station, my bf noticed he had lost his wallet. It had fallen out of his pocket after we’d paid for our tickets and walked down to the metro.

My bf got pretty stressed, and started calling me ugly names and saying he wouldn’t have lost his wallet if it wasn’t for my ”adhd ass” always being in a hurry, and that it was my fault. I told him to go look for it instead of arguing with me, but he shouted at me that we’re abroad and it has most definitely been stolen.

I managed to convince him to go look for it while I stayed back with our luggage. I waited for what felt like an eternity until he finally appeared — without his wallet. He was still really angry at me, and I started internalizing the thought that everything was my fault, which triggered a panic attack for me in the metro. I was hyperventilating and crying in front of everyone, and several random women approached me and offered me their seats and asked my bf if he knows me. I have no idea what he said, but he didn’t step up or say anything to me.

A couple of hours later, I had calmed down and my bf seemed to have forgiven me because he was in a better mood. He then confessed to me that he had actually found his wallet when he went looking for it but decided not to telll me to play a prank on me. Or, in his words, ”teach me a lesson”, since I’m always stressed and in a hurry. I was so confused and hurt, but when I tried to explain to him that it was cruel of him to let me have a fullblown panic attack while knowing he had the wallet all along, he doubled down and said it served me right.

I want to move forward from this incident. I love my bf very much and we’ve been together for a long time. This is both his and my first relationship. I am however worried that he’s capable to do something like this. I’d like advice on how to make him realize his behavior and how to move forward.

One person (from a notification in messenger where they transitioned to talking) was telling her she never got told she could stop talking to him and the timing was right around the time she got off work and home.

I never made a stink about it all. I merely just brought up how I saw a notification of somebody who was seemingly trying to claim ownership of my wife, that resulted in her telling me she'll block him and work on setting boundaries and understanding when people are being nice and when they are trying alternative motives. 

Things seem to be okay but then it started to happen again where she would emotionally cut me off and just constantly tell me she's tired. One night (not proud that I needed to check) I checked her Snapchat friends list over one of the people that she was talking to. I noticed a name that I never knew she talked to and I click on the profile to see who that person was and I see saved photos of my wife that are very NSFW, along with 15 to 20 photos of her just doing hearts with her hands that he saved. I left our home for 24 hours and just drove and spoke to my sister about everything and ended up the night after talking to her and telling her I'm not forgiven her but we have a family that I do not want to break apart so we'll get over it and get past it.

Since rent in our city is expensive (no one-bedrooms under $1,200/month), I agreed that he’d pay $500/month plus half of the utilities.

It felt fair at the time, but over a year later, I’ve fallen into debt from unexpected expenses, and he earns about $20K more than I do. I’ve asked him to contribute more, but he gets annoyed and says things like, “Then we won’t go on dates,” even though we rarely do. He insists he pays for everything else—which isn’t true.

He brought his dog when he moved in. I love the dog, but its shedding is an added chore. He also stores all his stuff in what was supposed to be a guest room. He uses the house like a full tenant but insists “it’s not his house,” so he shouldn’t pay 50/50.

The one time he offered to contribute more was when the pool liner needed replacing. It’s a $4,000 job, and he offered $1,000–$2,000. I appreciate the gesture, but it’s the only large expense he’s ever volunteered to help with.

It’s becoming hard not to feel taken advantage of, and I don’t want to let resentment build up. I want to understand his point of view—but also explain mine clearly.

So this started on Sunday.  To preface, my wife absolutely hates her job.  She vents about it regularly, I listen and give her hugs and all the other good husband stuff.  She's been hunting for a new job, I've been very supportive of that, but she doesn't want to take a huge paycut anywhere despite me telling her we can afford it and the money isn't worth her being this miserable.  She persists at her current job and I continue letting her vent.  Until Sunday.  Sunday was one of the worst days she's had there in a while.  She got off work and started venting about the day, but the more she vented the angrier she got and before long she was literally screaming at me as though I were one of her coworkers that pissed her off.  Logically, I recognize that nothing she was saying was truly directed at me.  She wasn't mad at me, she was mad at her job.  That said, I grew up in a not great home and endured a lot of verbal and physical abuse as a kid.  I'm in therapy for that now.  I decided that this is not something I want to endure in adulthood and so I resolved to establish this boundary for my wife and I.  Monday after I got off work, I told her that we needed to talk about Sunday.  I told her I know she wasn't mad at me and everything else, but she can't scream at me like she did on Sunday.  Immediately she hugged me and started crying.  I told her it was OK, and she can still vent, I reiterated I know she wasn't mad at me or anything like that.  She said it wasn't OK and apologized again.  She was in the process of cleaning the kitchen when I got home, so I helped her finish cleaning the kitchen in silence and then I went to a friend's house for a standing, weekly D&D game (my wife has no interest in attending this game, in case that's important).  I got home around 10, which is kind of late, but we're usually up until 10:30-11, to find my wife was already asleep in bed.  I was a little worried, but her shift the next day was super early so I tried not to think too much about it.

All of this seemed mostly fine, but here's why I'm now concerned.

I work an 8-5 M-F job and we have a routine where whoever wakes up later texts the other when they get up a good morning text.  I sent the text and I didn't hear back until almost the end of my shift and it was from fb messenger instead of texting me apologizing for not sending me anything sooner, but her phone died.  Alright, weird, but no big deal.  Wouldn't have thought a single thing about it.  I get home and she keeps finding reasons not to kiss me hello.  She's trying to figure out if she paid a bill, so I leave her to it and go log onto my computer in our office.  I'm in a little bit of a funk over all of this, so I'm just kinda staring at my computer trying to pull myself out of it, thinking surely I'm just too much in my head about this.  I'm making some progress and a friend messages me asking me to jump into a game and I figure that might help so I play for an hour or so.  At some point, my wife came into the office and got on her computer.  I was a little distracted and usually she comes up next to me and scratches the back of my head in moments like that until I have a free moment to kiss her.  Instead, she went straight to her chair on the other side of the room.  I finished up that match and told my friend I was going to take a break.  I rolled my chair to my wife and asked what was wrong.  She managed a weak 'nothing' but started crying.  I put my arm around her, she holds onto it and doesn't push me away or anything, but she's crying and I ask her at least two more times to please tell me what's wrong.  She won't do it, she just shrugs.  I ask her if I fucked up or if she's mad at me or anything else and she keeps shaking her head.  I ask her if she wants to go to the living room and watch a movie.  She agrees and spends the first part of the movie curled up into me and still crying.  By the end she's still acting weird, but she was no longer crying and was at least talking about the movie.  We go to bed and that whole routine was also off.  Yesterday because of our work schedules we didn't see each other at all.  She hasn't woken up yet today to send her good morning text, so I'm not entirely sure where we're at but I can't get this out of my head.

So did I do something wrong here?

  
\-Edit- So Reddit kept telling me that my post was automatically deleted.  I'm sorry I haven't responded, I assumed that there were restrictions on throwaways for this sub and I decided to just not post anything.  I've read through the comments and I appreciate you all.

I gave her space after our first child as I thought she would need a bit of time to adjust but I am no longer a priority for her. I noticed this recently when I realised that she doesn't like me even touching her, like she looks annoyed that I hug her or put my arm around her. 

She supports me at work and she is a great mother to our children but I am always the last thing she considers when making decisions. Some examples. She cooks dinner for her and the kids and not me, She cleans her clothes and the kids not mine, she will put the shopping away but leave my bits in the bags. All of which I do but obviously take care of her things too, I could never imagine cooking for myself and the kids and not her. These are small things but she put our house on the market when I was away on a business trip. I mean... I have no words. 

She never touches me and I don't mean in a sexual way, just like hugs or kisses. I can't remember the last time she reached over to me in bed and hugged me or snuggled up on the couch. Then when it comes to sex it's on her terms only. She has gradually over the years put so many rules in place that the only time we do it is when she texts me from the other room to which I feel dirty going through with because I obviously want to do it but it's not sexy, it's not loving it's just like she's doing it so she can tick a box. 

After our first child was born we didn't go on a date for about 5 years because she didn't want anyone else looking after the kids. She would say things like ""we had kids so we could parent them not other people"". I think this really hurt our relationship as we didn't do anything together, just us, for 5 years, and that's not an exaggeration. 

I'm starting to wonder what the point is? I have brought these topics up with her on multiple occasions and it's not got any better. I am someone that wants to be loved and given affection and I want to give it back but if it's not appreciated I don't know what to do. It was never like this before kids.

Edit:

The relationship ended. Thanks for everyone’s input. 

First off, everything else in our relationship is fine. But I’ve noticed as of late every comment he makes has to be sexual, as if his sense of humor revolves around it. Think of Robert California as a horny teen. (We are not teens) And it’s to the point that I don’t know if I’m the one being sensitive and this is normal or if he’s just immature. For example just yesterday one of my neighbors was arrested for SA a mail lady. Exposed his junk and rubbed one out in front of her. His response: “I don't get what the big deal is. She should feel flattered that he'd crank hog to her” Literally said it twice in two message threads. That’s disgusting, and I responded with “this is not funny please stop making comments like that.”

Another instance yesterday as well he was telling me about a time he went to a bar that had a high cover charge and said “for that price there had better be a girl on the inside on her knees ready to SMD”

^ that’s usually his go to when something is expensive. But it’s just remarks like that that have gotten so insanely old. I’m not a horny teen I don’t think these are funny.

Would this be a case of me being uptight? Or would you say it’s something else? I’m open to any and all sides. Thanks for reading!",1767800436.0,,1767958681.0,False,True,N/A,,False,False,False,False,False,0.91,N/A

While looking through his phone I stumbled across messages between him and this woman. It seems like she's an online sex worker and he's bought pics from her. He also regularly commented on her body.

I'm heartbroken honestly and I'm having trouble even explaining my emotions atm. I love him with every fiber of my being and I trusted him. Even right now I'm trying to justify his actions. It certainly feels like cheating.

First off. My wife looks amazing in gym clothes.   She mentioned off hand a few months ago that someone approached her and asked her out. She said no and she told me. I told her it was bound to happen because of her looks and that was that.  

A few months later she mentions that she has a male gym friend that chats with her some at the gym. Then she tells me that they had swapped insta account info cause they like the same books. 

Fast forward to last month. We have an open phone policy and I asked to see her phone cause I was angry and thought she may have messaged her gym friend. I found their messages on insta. It was mostly full of gym reels but I kept seeing that he would often tell her good morning or goodnight. I told her that those comments bothered me because that’s my territory- not his. 

The next day she reveals that this friend is the same dude that had asked her out a few months before. She also revealed that she felt really guilty and admitted to sending “sexual” funny gym reels that allude to sex positions and stuff. And that she engaged in flirty back and forth banter with him about what they liked in the bedroom. 

Then she admits that these convos were in vanish mode. 

She admits to how wrong this looks to me. She also admits that looking back now she sees just how badly she messed up. She swears that there was never any sexting. No “I want to do xyz with you”. And that they never met up in person. We share our location at all times on iPhone so meeting up with him somewhere would have been really hard for me to not notice. 

We’ve argued about it several times: about How much her using vanish mode has shattered my trust. I even asked her to swear on the lives of our children - which she did. She says that she wasn’t attracted to him. It was just for attention.  And that they never sexted. She swears she would never have cheated on me. 

I don’t know where to go from here. I want to believe her. I’ve tried my best to get her to admit to more but she is holding strong at “it was just attention” and “there was no sexting”. 

She cries every time we fight about it. She understands how bad it looks and says she’ll do anything to fix it. To rebuild my trust. 

I asked her to message him - to finally call out how wrong it was and that she wasn’t going to be talking to him anymore. She agreed, sent the message, and blocked him. We still have the open phone policy. She said she saw him once since at the gym and he just gave her the cold stare. 

She’s taking every step I ask to make it right. She’s open to cancelling gym. To deleting insta. She’ll do whatever I ask. She’s showing genuine remorse and taking every action and saying she wants to rebuild my trust more than anything in the world. 

I want to move on. But fucking vanish mode is messing with my mind. 

Update: during our fight over the weekend she also revised that the reason he approached her to begin with was because she “locked eyes” with him across the gym multiple times. And before he asked her out, He asked if she liked what she saw and she said yes :( ",1752179908.0,,1752180324.0,False,True,N/A,,False,False,False,False,False,0.91,N/A

My mom uses Chat for practically anything: finding recipes, creating a meal plan for the week, writing emails, finding a gluten free pizza place nearby, etc... Most frightening to me, however, is when she told me how excited she was about how Chat helped her deal with a conflict between her and my dad. I don’t know if he knows that she did that.

Additionally, she runs a small business, which prides itself on being quite eco-friendly. She has been telling her employees to use Chat or Gemini to help find certain files in the database and have the ai search through those files and summarize the information. 

Ugh sometimes it feels like her brain is shriveling up because of how little work she is actually doing (this is an exaggeration, but also a fear). How does she not see that she’s offloading any learning experience to a fucking computer? How does she not see that encouraging all of her employees to use these systems negates any eco-friendly initiatives they do as a company?? 

We’ve been planning a debate or civil conversation about this. I would love any and all help in how I should go forward with this conversation and even our relationship. I think this has caused a pretty significant rift in our relationship. I still love her, of course, but this weighs really heavy on me when I’m around her... She’s told me countless times that this will not change anything about how she uses chat, and i know that, but i guess i have hope that maybe i can get through to her as her daughter?

We’ve had a brief conversation about it over text in which she said “Do you think that on mass the world will stop using ai?  Even if USA completely bans it, the rest of the world won’t. They will be faster to innovate, faster to create, and ultimately have the power. I guess you have to decide which thing you are more scared of.  IMHO, maybe ai could help us solve the water and electrical problem.  But I doubt water and electrical can solve ai problem. I’m not ignorant to the downside of ai. I would rather be planning for it instead of hoping it will go away”

Idk… it felt like she raised me to be this person who stands up for what i believe in and for the people (and the planet) that are being harmed by those in power. She raised me to know that yes, my impact is small but still important. It’s weird to be directing this passion and anger and whatever else im feeling towards her. 

And yes, I know that AI is a tool and can certainly be a cool way to offload some tasks or do things that otherwise would take forever. But currently with the lack of any regulation, possibly for the next 10 years (thanks orange man), I truly believe these “tools” are doing more harm than good. ya know?? idk im stressed

It's mainly just oral, but we do make out pretty often. I was making out with him last weekend, and he told me that he doesn't like oral or the vigina. For context, we're both virgins still. 
I told him it was ok, but honestly, I dont know how I feel now. Im on the more chubby side, so it was kind of a blow to my confidence.

 He always compliments me, and he doesn't really care what my body looks like, but I can't help but feel like he just finds my body uncomfortable. I feel like im being selfish by feeling this way because I get setting boundaries is important. But he hasn't had any problems with it up until so I dont really know what to do. I couldn't find anything online about how to help the situation, so I came to reddit.
I will also clarify that he is amazing and sweet. His mother is definitely a little crazy so that hasn't helped at all either. And i wanna say that his mother scared him into being uncomfortable with the idea of sex. Anything would help.

EDIT.

OK, so I've seen the chats, and it's a pain sending a message to everyone. So I'll just type it here.
So the way I put this makes it sound like he doesn't enjoy intimacy. He does very much, and he also initiates it too. He's bisexual with a preference for woman hes only ever liked one guy. His mother was totally cool with him being gay too so it's not like she scared him into not being gay or whatnot. He was a very sheltered kid cause his mom is kinda a controlish person but mainly cause it gave her control after she was in a bad relationship. His mother is great other than that. He's definitely not asexual I know that he's very kinky and likes to sub more than top. I dont think they gave him like a good talk. I think they said if he picks it in, a woman can get pregnant type of talk but not any information other than that. Im pretty sure his mother is more to blame for that as she's very overprotective of him. She also hates my guts cause I tell him that he actually has a choice in what he wants to do or say. That's another topic though lol so I won't go into too much detail. ",1760439411.0,,1760497075.0,False,True,N/A,,False,True,False,False,False,0.92,N/A

I will admit I was trying to be sneaky because we had a disagreement the other day about how I need it during sex to get off. I explained to him that it’s not that I necessarily need it but that it gets the job done faster than my fingers alone. He believes I use it too much and that I can’t get off without it. I don’t disagree with him however I am not going to be made to feel guilty for masturbating. I understand where he’s coming from because I do use it every time in order to climax. I am just seeking advice on how to approach him about it since we are arguing and I just think he’s being ridiculous and he thinks i am just defending myself. ,1757271701.0,,False,False,True,N/A,,False,True,False,False,False,0.9,N/A

I (34f) have been married to my husband (35m) for 12 years. A few weeks ago, he came out to me as pansexual and shared that he’s interested in exploring polyamory. I love and support him as a person, and I want him to live an authentic life… but I don’t want that kind of relationship.

I’m a straight woman who wants a monogamous relationship with a partner who is exclusively attracted to women. I feel awful even saying that because I fully support the LGBTQ+ community. However, I finally was able to admit to myself my sexual preference is what I want and need in a relationship to feel emotionally safe, respected, and desired.

This all comes on top of some serious issues we’ve already been facing—mainly around financial honesty on his end. I’ve always been the main income earner and I feel like that is taken advantage of sometimes. We’re currently living in short-term housing after relocating for my new job, with no family or support system nearby, and we share two dogs that we both love deeply. Which just adds to the guilt I feel trying to work through this. 

It’s a logistical nightmare to even think about separating. I don’t know how I’d afford an apartment on my own right now, and I’m scared of starting over but I’m also exhausted from constantly compromising myself for the sake of keeping the peace.

I won’t say how long it’s been since we’ve had sex because frankly I’m so embarrassed by it. But it’s been a LONG time. I lost the feeling of wanting to be intimate with him over time after some of the dishonest things he’s done… Mainly inviting his mother (who is not a safe, or stable person) to live with us, rent free, after I told him I wasn’t comfortable with it and I would rather figure out how to support her where she was currently living. Over time this and all of the financial stress he’s caused has compounded to me not wanting to be in a physical relationship. As a person with a fairly high sex drive, it’s been difficult for me to navigate that feeling. It’s actually added to my guilt about this situation because maybe this contributed to his new identity. 

After a few weeks of denying what I was feeling, I finally made an appointment to talk through everything with a therapist. I’m hoping to understand if my response is normal or if I’m being too hard on him and maybe just looking for a way out…

I’ll always love him as a person and be there for him, but I don’t think I can keep pretending like this is a relationship I want to be in. I want us both to live fully and honestly—and right now, it feels like we’re holding each other back.

If you’ve been in a similar situation, how did you navigate it? I’m scared, and I feel like I’m crumbling under the weight of what comes next. 😮‍💨

I work nights and she recently started a waitressing job, where she’s made a new group of friends — one of them being a guy she’s gotten unusually close to.

At first, I didn’t know about him at all. I later found out they’d hung out at a fair, gone to the gym together (even though I was told it was a girl friend), and he’s part of a group chat she never mentioned. When I brought it up, she deleted all their texts before I could see them. That’s when I started feeling like something was off.

She’s called him for help fixing a flat tire — I’m a mechanic and she didn’t tell me about it at all. She also attended a group movie night sleepover where he was present, but didn’t mention he’d be there until after the fact. She insists they’re just friends and nothing happened, but I’m struggling to figure out what level of secrecy is reasonable in a relationship.

We’re still affectionate, living together, and talk about the future — but I’ve been feeling more uneasy lately. I’m trying to figure out if I’m reacting to real boundary issues, or just letting insecurity take over.

How do you determine when emotional closeness with someone outside the relationship crosses a line?
Where do healthy emotional boundaries usually fall in a situation like this?

For context. I work my ass of at a Bar. I'm talking 10-12h a day. It's exhausting but it's good money. I don't need to worry if i can pay rent or eat. 

My Boyfriend doesn't work. He finished his alternative service (in lieu of military service) wich is in my country legally required to do as man over 18 a few months ago. 
I didn't mind him not having a job until he started to move into my home 2 months ago. The apartment i pay for. I kindly started to ask him to please get a job so he can contribute to bills etc. Because since he moved in i payed for everything. Food, dates, going out, utilities etc. He hasn't paid in a restaurant since before he moved in. I'm really neat with my money and keep track of every outgoing. And it became noticeably more. 
Got into a few fights because of it.
He since agreed to dip in and help as well as get a summer job until he found something he really wants to do.
Fine by me. 
Now to the thing i need advice for.

Recently he started to ask if he can get money back for the things he paid for. 
Keep in mind i pay for all the things above and he just started to help with the groceries.
I never once asked if he could pay me back.

One time i needed a few things from the store and he asked if he could have the 40€ back he spent. I was baffled. I gave it to him and tried to explain how it kinda hurt me how i pay for everything and he doesn't even acknowledge that and then once he has to pay for something once, asks for his money back. 
He apologized and i let it go because i thought he understood. 
Yesterday i came home from work and a few friends from different bars/Restaurants wanted to go for a swim. I and my bf went. By then i walked quite a lot and my feet hurt like hell. so i suggested  to get a Taxi because well. It was 4:30am. And no bus was driving yet. Usually i would've paid but i forgott my wallet at home and had no way of paying so my bf paid the 20€ to my home. 
At home he asked if i could pay him back. For the Taxi we both took. Exactly the thing we talked about. Repeated. I was so angry and hurt and just extremely disappointed that he apparently didn't understand a thing i tried to tell him. He tried to explain that because it was my idea and he would've walked the 40 minutes home i should pay. No where in his reasoning he mentioned that the reason we took a taxi was because i just worked 10 bloody hours so i can keep paying for both of us. 
After i went on the couch because i was so sick of repeating myself over and over again why it hurt me just for him to not understand. I just wanted to sleep. after some more attempts at explaining he just apologized and wanted to cuddle. 
But I don't think he really understood. And I don't know how to explain it to him. 
He also said that if he buys something he wants it to be a present not a Taxi.
But he never does. In Restaurants i always pay and he repeats every single time ""I'll get it next time"" but never does. 

I'm just exhausted and tired and can't continue to pay for 2 people instead of one. It's not the 1950 where one person can keep a family alive by doing one job anymore. 
I wanna do something nice for me. Wanna buy something without overthinking it over and over if i can. I know i could. But instead I'm listening to my Bf say that the 750€ he just got from selling a painting last week is going straight to the Art suply box instead of helping with the 1.500€ i spend every month and then having the audacity to ask for 20€ back.

Please just help me make him understand.",1751598025.0,,False,False,True,N/A,,False,False,False,False,False,0.97,N/A

I am atheist/agnostic, and was raised southern baptist. I don't like organized religion, I think the Bible is just a book written by men. I have complicated feelings about religion, but I am pro choice, am a ally of the lgbtq+ community, go to protests and hold other extremely liberal views. My morals just don't mesh with most religions. But I'd fight for ANYONE'S right to believe in what they want or not. 

This coworker [60sF] has invited me to church before, and once tried to pay to fix my car because God pressed her to. I obviously declined both, politely. I like this coworker, I think she's very nice. But unfortunately I am aware that she told somebody else that the gay guy who works with us is going to hell. I don't think about that and I don't let it affect my job, but I feel like it gives me a view on what her religious beliefs are specifically.

Yesterday after work I went into my purse and I found a card with my name on it. It was a beautiful handmade card that she painted herself. There was $100 taped inside, and a note saying God pressed her to give me money. She said I shouldn't thank her, I should thank God. She said Jesus loves me and a few other religious things. She said I should take the money and do something with my kids. When I tried to chase her down to get it back she was pulling out of the parking lot. 

And here is where I don't know what to do. I could definitely use the money that hundred dollars is two great days out with my kids! But I feel like accepting it is going to place an obligation on me to either go to church with her or listen to her or I'm not sure. It feels like when a guy takes you out to dinner and he pays sometimes there's that unspoken obligation or pressure to go further than you want. My parents who are religious said I should keep the money and not consider it an obligation. My mom has said she has felt pressed to give money to strangers in the same way. My old boss and Mentor (who has more of my view on religion) says I need to give it back to her and set a boundary. When I asked the AI program that I use it suggested keeping the money but setting the boundary. I have to see her in like an hour and I am still torn on what to do and I need to make a decision fast. If I'm being honest I could really use the money to do something nice with my kids. That hundred pays for a picnic day and then it gets us to go see Lilo and Stitch at the movies. 

I would love and appreciate some advice from some neutral third parties who don't know me or her. If anyone bothers responding I appreciate you in advance! ",1747828042.0,,False,False,True,N/A,,False,False,False,False,False,1.0,N/A

Since we got into a relationship my bf has told me he’s a cuck and would love for me to just stay home while he goes to work and every so often have a man come over to have sex. At first I was a little skeptical, but we’ve had this conversation multiple times and every time he’s reassured me I don’t have to if i don’t want to. I have never been the type of girl to meet someone and have a one night stand. I was a virgin when we met and never had a relationship before him. And ofc I would love to not have to work, and he gets paid enough to cover all of our bills so that’s not the issue. I guess I’m just wondering if it’s a good idea. I would obviously be safe and since it’s a cuck thing he would be there. But i think im worried about him throwing it back in my face that hes paying for everything or that someone in our small community will find out somehow and it get back to his parents that im sleeping around, and his parents love me. He’s not the type of man to throw stuff back in my face but if i learned anything about men it’s that one thing can complete break their mask and reveal their true colors. I love this man so much and honestly not going to work would help me so much with my schooling and I’d be able to get done faster with less stress.

edit: we have an amazing relationship outside of this issue, this is really just a battle within my own head. He ofc would like to go forward with it but he’s not forcing me to or trying to coerce me. He’s okay with either outcome. We still have great sex without cucking lol



edit 2: for everyone thinking that my bf is trying to trap he is not, i feel this got lost in the comments so im writing it here. I do not have to quit my job for us to do this, hes not saying i have to quit my job, hes not saying i have to cuck him, he’s not secretly trying to traffic me. He loves me and he’s a good man, i mean shit he had to work a double on Valentine’s Day and all he did was write me love notes. He even offered for me to quit my job without doing this. I have so many things i want to do that work is keeping me back from and staying at home would help so much with that, plus i have a little side hustle that i could pick up so much time for and start making my own money again from my home but i cant do that with my full time job. I promise im not defending a bad man and i wish i could explain our situation in a way where you get the entire picture but that’s hard to do. We both get excited from this idea and want to try it out, i guess i just wanted help on figuring out some more logistics about how it could be done in the safest way possible, and in my update we decided on a pretty fair plan.

I care about her deeply, but her family is extremely dysfunctional, and I honestly can’t imagine ever being close with them. 

Her mom is the center of the chaos. She's in love with having a baby but dislikes actual parenting later on. Instead, she lashes out in anger over small things, then later apologizes and admits she was wrong. This cycle has taught her kids not to respect her at all. 

Her oldest son walks all over her and has dragged the younger son (14) into drinking and smoking. The younger one also has intense anger issues. Screaming to get attention and ridiculing anyone who shows “weakness.” Their mom enables both boys and tries to win their approval by letting them do whatever they want. 

On the flip side, she comes down hardest on her daughters, my girlfriend and her sister. They’re both hardworking and kind, but her mom constantly criticizes them and manipulates them emotionally. Growing up, my girlfriend often stepped into a parent role, taking care of the house and shielding her siblings from her mother’s anger. After a personal loss a while back, she realized she couldn’t carry this burden anymore, and she created distance. She moved in with me, saving her relationship with her mom which is now is civil but strained. 

The dad is just physically present, never saying anything. Not shielding the kids from their mother, and letting his wife get ridiculed by his sons. 

Here’s where my struggle comes in: I’m fine attending birthdays and major holidays. When I’m around her family, I grey rock, short polite conversations. Nothing deeper. But my girlfriend wants me to actually build a relationship with them and to go on family outings whether its bowling or actual trips. 

When we first got together, I told her honestly that I might never like her family. She said that was okay. But recently she admitted she thought I’d warm up to them over time, and she’s disappointed that I haven’t. Now she says she's a package deal with her family. The problem is, i'd say they're not bad people. Just broken and insanely dishonest with their feelings, ignoring the issues they have inside and not actually resolving fights. But they do want me to be a part of their family. 

So my question is: What’s the healthiest way to set boundaries with my girlfriend’s family without hurting our relationship? and how can I tell if I’m being unreasonable?",1757592976.0,,False,False,True,N/A,,False,False,False,False,False,0.87,N/A

Me and my boyfriend have been together 7 years and I truly love him with every fraction of my soul.

My boyfriend is genuinely a good guy and he treats me well about 80% of the time—he can be sweet, caring, supportive, and helpful. That’s why this is so confusing and painful for me.

But when he gets very frustrated/angry (and sometimes when his OCD gets triggered), he vents in a way that scares me: he throws things or hits objects. It happens roughly once every six months, but it still makes me feel unsafe.

I tried bringing it up, and he dismissed me and said it’s “bullshit,” like I’m overreacting. Whenever I raise something that bothers me, he becomes very defensive instead of hearing me.

There’s also an issue about nudist beaches. He likes going, and I’m not comfortable with that world at all. He told me it’s about “freedom” and not sexual. Later I found a Telegram channel on his phone with “beautiful women at nudist beaches,” and I realized it’s basically a fetish/turn-on for him. When I confronted him, he said that if there’s an attractive woman there, of course it turns him on. That hurt me because it felt dishonest and also insensitive to my feelings.

Yesterday he called me many times. We spoke a bit and agreed to talk face-to-face in a calm way, without labeling it as a “lecture.” When I gently said he’d been heavy/stressful for me this week, he said it’s unrealistic to expect him to come in a good mindset because it is a lecture, and that I’m basically going to tell him he’s a bad person. He started yelling, said he’s “fine” and hasn’t done anything wrong, and that I need to accept I won’t get the apology or answer I’m looking for. He said I humiliated him, called me “stubborn/like talking to a wall,” told me I’m “talking bullshit,” and then hung up on me.

Now I feel like everything becomes my fault: I can’t express discomfort without being mocked or yelled at, and I’m also struggling with the feeling that he wasn’t honest and doesn’t respect my boundaries. I’m really sad because there is a lot of good—but I also feel like this isn’t healthy for me.

I've decided not to say anything to my BF while I'm here at the conference. I know that will be to the dismay of some but I do now agree that this type of conversation is better done in person and with some distance from the conference. I don't know when I will have it and a lot of people said to take it to my grave and perhaps I will but because this was such a turning point to really wake up and realize how I was letting alcohol affect my life, it's now a story line that's created a huge shift in my life direction to incredible change. 

Thank you again for all of your comments and perspectives. 🙏







First time poster so bear with me and I'll try and keep this short. Last year, I [35f] was at an annual work conference and hung out with a couple people after each day. Some I knew as acquaintances and others I knew from over the years. 

One of them is a married man [40m] who I knew a little. Well, lots of drinking ensued, I blacked out and somehow ended up in his hotel room and we slept together. 

I fucked up and I know it. I have never done something like this before and I've felt awful about it since, to the point that I've quit alcohol so as never to put myself in this type of situation ever again. 

Now, I've been dating a great guy [34m] recently for the last 2 months and things are going well. I leave tomorrow for the conference again. I don't know if I should tell my new bf what happened and let the chips fall where they may or if this never needs to be brought up. 

I broke my own moral code and it's something I'll always have to live with but I'm really seeking advice if this should be brought up. No I will not be speaking to the married man and if we happen to cross paths I will keep it short and move somewhere else.

85,2026/2/27,17: 8:59,1mfjqp9,relationshipadvice,Update: My[31m] wife[31f] is pregnant with a third child I never wanted.

Using ChatGPT for formatting and spellcheck — typing quickly on mobile and trying to make it coherent in my second language is quite the chore in itself and i dont care about those stupid dashes it puts everywhere as long as people can understand my writing.

Well to start: Yes, it was a Clearblue test that said 1–2 weeks, but after my wife had her IUD removed and got checked a few days ago, they confirmed she’s actually 7 weeks along. So far, the pregnancy seems normal and not ectopic. So it’s still early, but not as early as we thought.

I’ve got a doctor’s appointment in October to talk about a vasectomy. After that, he’ll refer me to a specialist — and the wait times there are long too. At least the ball is rolling, even if a bit too late. At least, we won’t have to worry about this happening again in the future.

Thanks to the few people who gave me advice instead of just telling me I should’ve gone to the doctor a long time ago or used condoms — I already knew that.

The advice I got was genuinely helpful and made me realize that maybe I was being too rash in my thinking. We need to lower our living standards for a while to make things work, rather than uproot our entire lives for cheaper housing and school fees.

I’ve taken a hard look at our finances, and if we really tighten our belts, we can still move next year. I should also be able to build another bedroom myself later on. But it’s going to require major cutbacks. No more impulse purchases from my wife — she also needs to start paying her credit bills and parking tickets on time, and actually start using the parking spot I pay for every month. No more spontaneous ice creams or water park trips with the kids etc. Gifts for birthdays and Christmas will have to be cheaper — dolls and coloring books instead of a Nintendo Switch. I’ll be picking up extra shifts whenever I can too. My wife is already feeling nauseous and even more forgetful, so she might need to go on medical leave soon which will decrease our available funds. All our planned trips are cancelled. That money needs to go toward a bigger car and baby supplies — we didn’t keep anything from before since we thought we were done.

I’m also continuing to remind her to speak to her psychologist. She said she would — about five months ago — but she still hasn’t, even though I keep bringing it up. She hasn’t been sleeping well and has been feeling low, detached, and forgetful. This has been going on since long before the pregnancy.

Honestly, I still think that — logically — we shouldn’t be having another child. But my wife is very emotionally driven. She even admitted that she knows she’s being selfish — making us sacrifice so much for something that she wants.

I do feel a bit more prepared now — if the pregnancy goes well — at least when it comes to money. I’m still not optimistic about the future, but thank you to those who gave me solid advice. It gave me some peace of mind. I’m sure the baby might bring some joy when it arrives. But right now, all I can see is the work and the sacrifices we’ll have to make. I know the kids won’t be thrilled about all the changes either, and I expect they’ll give me a hard time about it too.

But here’s the biggest unresolved issue: I think I’ve started to resent my wife. She’s let me carry the full load at home for so long, and now she wants to add even more responsibility — at the cost of our quality of life. It feels like only her feelings matter, while mine don’t count at all.

We barely talk anymore. The last real conversation we had was when she said she felt so nauseous she might throw up — and then told me it was my fault. I said that while I might have “done” this to her, she still has the power to end the pregnancy and stop feeling this way snyting she wants. She shouldn’t blame me for a choice she refuses to make — especially when she knew the risks just as well as I did when we slept together. She just went quiet and went back to looking at her phone.

Now, I just feel like an asshole on top of feeling tired and sad. I don’t feel like touching her or even having conversations like I used to. It feels like I’m living with a lazy roommate who just sits on her phone all day, leaves her stuff, dirty dishes, and clothes everywhere — just like the kids. And if I don’t clean it up, it simply won’t get done. Her phone always seems to come first.

She did promise to help out more, but so far I haven’t seen any change. Still, I want to give her a chance. I want to make this work. If she can take some of the load off my shoulders, maybe I won’t feel so opposed to having this baby. But I also know I need to deal with this resentment before it becomes an even bigger problem. Maybe if she helps out more it will go away or maybe i should just suck it up and fake being happy until it becomes real. I dont know.

What if this were the other way around? What if I just worked and spent all my free time at home playing video games, while my wife also worked but still had to take care of everything else at home by herself? What kind of advice would you give her? Maybe it’s something I can learn from too.

Any advice from people who’ve gone through something similar would really help.

Edit: sorry i havent been super active, wife is on sickleave so im even more busy now. Its like having a third kid at home that creates even bigger messes.

All of a sudden I had a pillow over my face. (No I wasn’t suffocating) I was laughing because at first I wondered if it was some kind of joke. But then 20 ish seconds later the pillow came off, and a few minutes (like 2-3) he finished. 

This has literally never happened to me before..?!? He’s never done this or event yelled at me for those who may think he’s abusive. He never responded when I asked him why he did that. I couldn’t bring myself to ask again the day after it happened because he failed to say anything when asked initially. Now it’s still on my mind 2 weeks later. I feel embarrassed. 

Let me know what you think this means. Again this was a one time thing, but still keeps me up at night. If you think I’m being crazy please tell me. I appreciate you reading and for the brutal honesty you leave below lol. ",1749872599.0,,False,False,True,N/A,,False,True,False,False,False,0.79,N/A

89,2026/2/27,17: 8:59,1kid919,relationshipadvice,"Boyfriend [35M], of five years, called me [29F] pathetic after reading an essay I am drafting dissecting my relationship with sex.",https://www.reddit.com/r/relationshipadvice/comments/1kid919/boyfriend_35m_of_five_years_called_me_29f/,/r/relationshipadvice/comments/1kid919/boyfriend_35m_of_five_years_called_me_29f/,17,Lucky-Requirement-16,50,"I wrote a very emotional rough draft essay that I wanted to eventually start a blog out of. It was five pages long and a kind of a modge-podge of topics I've been contemplating over the course of a month. You see I recently got super invested in the Pompoir community on Reddit and I was empowered to learn about women who had overcome their struggle to orgasm. Particularly vaginal orgasm, which is something I've always really struggled with and felt it was impossible to achieve. 

I wanted to connect with women who were on the same journey as me, being in a long term loving relationship with a high libido partner and struggling with the embarrassment of vaginal numbness and not consistently achieving orgasm with my partner. Because I used to hate myself so much until I found out I am not the only woman who can be super horny but feels like sex is just a let down. Reading posts that felt like they were taken straight from my brain, was the biggest relief I've felt in a long time. 

So I started writing and I started off things by venting about some frustrations with my boyfriend, It was very long so in essence I wrote down my feelings about some things he does which I don't like and I've asked him to stop but he doesn't. I wrote what I felt, that he doesn't have this desire to take a long time exploring my body and open up a dialogue about our pleasure imbalance… I mentioned that I felt like a sex robot, I kind of talked about how I should have advocated my needs better to him in the past which I didn't really know how to do at the time. I brought up some things he said to me before about my vaginal dryness and how it caused me to feel a lot of shame and how I detached from my body out of pure frustration from not functioning like ‘normal’. 

At the end I wrote a little bit about my desire to have more orgasms, because I do. I want to feel good, I want to feel ecstasy with my partner so badly. I want to make love and merge together and create a space where we can both get lost in each other and I want to be addicted to sex with him. Because I love him more than anything and I want to have a fulfilling sex life for myself. It just felt so simple really. Writing felt empowering to me, I was able to address some hang ups I’ve had with sex and talking about my feelings is how I release bad energy to make room for optimism and change.

I never intended to let him read this document. He seemed kind of annoyed that I didn't want him to read it and I didn't think there was anything he didn't already know in it. What the hell, maybe it could open up a dialogue. I knew he’d counter things, it’s his nature, but debating is healthy and we’re on year six of our relationship with plans to have a family and so on. What’s the worst that could happen? It would hurt if he didn't care at all but I could accept that and move on. 

He read it. His initial reaction seemed ambivalent, all he said was, 'it opens a can of worms' and ‘we need to better define what foreplay is’, then he moved on. I thought okay, that's positive and we went along with the night. Dinner was great. He was laughing a lot at the show and smiling at me, we cuddled on the couch, we went up to bed. 

I was in that stage where you’re really sleepy but your brain is shooting off lots of thoughts. I sleepily asked him if he cared about the essay. He told me that he had a counter argument for everything in it but that a strategy could be derived from it. Okay, cryptic but positive. I'm in no rush, these kinds of things need a better time and space to unpack.

The next morning we were up before the alarm but still resting all curled up in bed. What happened still feels like some crazy nightmare. All of a sudden he told me, 

“I’ve been thinking about your letter” (side note it was more of a diary type entry than letter.)

“Oh yeah” I asked, still half asleep then he quickly sits up looks over at me and says, 

“Yah. I think it’s pathetic.” Now I'm fully awake. 

“Everything you wrote I have a counter argument for”

He told me that I have bad hygiene down there. Something I had no idea about because he’s told me he loved my smell before… He’s put his face down there many times and sniffed all around like an animal and told me it was getting him hard. He told me that after sex my vagina has this rotten smell… that I need to go to a gynecologist. I’ve never heard him say this before but he’s adamant that he’s said it in the past. He said he was trying to protect me by not telling this before. I feel lied to. 

He told me that he finishes quickly because he feels me dry up when he’s inside me and he just wants to get it over with. But It doesn't bother me that he finishes quickly, that wasn't even in the letter. It’s more about the fact that I don’t orgasm from penetration… but forget it. I don't want to get off topic.  

He told me I don’t have a fucking clue about sex. He told me that my letter was really, really pathetic and if I ever posted it anywhere that I would be embarrassed. The last part felt so cruel. If I ever post this anywhere I'll feel embarrassed, because it's so pathetic… Then he just went cold to me, started cooing at our animals like it was a normal morning.

I’m going to book an appointment with a gynecologist … I read that my diet could be a probable cause or the fact we often use spit as lube can cause a PH disruption. Because I do practice good hygiene. As far as everything else. I regret letting him read the letter. I feel so numb, he thinks i’m pathetic. I feel guilty for opening a can of worms but I'm more shocked by how cruel he was with basically zero build up. 

What should my next step be after his cruel outburst this morning?

Before me, he never used condoms and always relied on withdrawal. I, on the other hand, have no intention of having unprotected sex.

In the past, I took the birth control pill for about five years (four different types), while still using condoms. Every time I experienced strong side effects: constant bloating, water retention, mood swings, and even depression with suicidal thoughts. Because of this, I decided I will never take it again — my body simply cannot tolerate it.

The problem is that now that we’re in a long-term relationship, my partner no longer wants to have sex. Until last month, we were still having sex (after many discussions about this topic and some trials to make him get used to the condom), sometimes in a fun way, even though he said he didn’t feel much. Then, on one specific occasion, he lost his erection, and since then he hasn’t wanted to do anything at all, saying that he no longer feels any libido.

I honestly don’t know what to do. I feel like the entire responsibility for contraception is being pushed onto me, because he insists that I should go back on the pill or, in the worst case, that we should “deal with it afterward.”

At the beginning of our relationship, when I was trying to understand how to solve this issue, he said he was interested in getting a vasectomy. Later on, however, he started saying that it’s too expensive and that even though he absolutely doesn’t want children, he doesn’t feel ready to do it yet. I understand his reasons and I don’t want to pressure him — which is exactly why condoms seem like the most obvious and reasonable solution to me.

I want to avoid any other hormonal contraceptive methods because:
1. I’m afraid of feeling unwell again;
2. it feels like I would be betraying myself.

I’ve looked into female condoms and my next step will be to try them, but once again I’m the one researching and looking for solutions, because he simply doesn’t want to talk about it. The fact that he isn’t trying to find any alternative makes me feel really bad.

He treats me well: he gives me gifts and is there for me when I need him. I know he cares about me and shows it in his own way. At the same time, though, there is no longer any intimacy between us, and I can see it in the fact that I’m always the one initiating physical affection with kisses and cuddling. Lately, this whole situation has been making me feel very low.

He is not very affectionate with words, partly because of difficult experiences in his past. I respect that, and so far I’ve stepped back in order not to pressure him, even though I feel lonely. Sometimes he says that he loves me, but he has never said the he is IN love with me; and now that the physical side of the relationship is gone as well, I feel unloved and unwanted.

I would really appreciate any advice or perspective, because I truly need it.

*Note: he is circumcised and he says that that's the reason why he can't feel much. +  I’ve also looked into other barrier methods, but from what I understand they are not very effective. As for the copper IUD, it tends to increase menstrual flow and pain (which are already severe for me), so I think I need to rule that out as an option.",1767564515.0,,False,False,True,N/A,,False,True,False,False,False,0.91,N/A

I sat my husband down a few days ago. I broke down and let all my feelings out. To say things have been so much better is an understatement. I feel so relieved to have gotten this off my shoulders. We have worked on our sexual relationship since then and I’m happy to say that I’m having orgasms and it feels AWESOME! 
Thanks so much to everyone for the advice, it will only get better from here. 



As the title reads..I have not been truthful with my now husband of half a year. We’ve been together for 2 years before marrying. 

A little backstory…I never had a great sexual relationship either with myself or other partners. The multiple partners I’ve had I haven’t been honest with either in fear that I would be deemed untrustworthy and even worse be pitied or be seen as weird since I can barely get myself off without it taking forever or sometimes not at all.

I love my husband. He’s a wonderful man. He’s average size and has never had a sexual partner before me. Over the years he’s read up on how to please women and makes me feel really good and we’ve gotten into a good groove of things for the most part but I’m not sure how to tell him that for whatever god forsaken reason, I just can’t get off. 

The only time I’ve been able to get off is (sorry for tmi) we are in doggy position and I have a vibrator. I don’t use my vibrator all the time because it makes me feel as if I’m hurting his feelings as if he can’t provide me with enough satisfaction from just him. 

I'm constantly thinking about how I look or sound or if it's been too long and if I should just give up and fake an orgasm and it makes me feel horrible. He's super attentive to me but it makes me feel bad..like really really bad. I've been eaten up with this guilt for our entire relationship. I don't know how to bring it up to him but I know I need to. I was fully prepared to just fake my orgasms for the rest of our sex life so that he would be happy and I won't have to ruin what we have but after hearing another similar Reddit story but from the male op’s perspective, it just makes me feel even more guilty. I don't want him to think it's something with him because it's hard for me to make myself orgasm so it's not like there's a skill issue or anything of that sort on his end. I also don't want him to think I don't trust him. I do absolutely trust him. I just don't even know how to come to face it myself. I don't know where to start and how I should bring this up to him. I honestly worry if something is just wrong with me and if I should just continue doing this for the rest of our sex life.

Another thought is I don't want him to feel like he isn't bringing enough to the table so to speak. He sometimes is self conscious when it comes to his skill and size and I really don't want to make him feel like any of this is because of his doing or is his fault

So Reddit…any advice on how I should bring this up to him? Has anyone had this same experience and what have you done to help fix things?

I Just want to say thank you so much for all the advice and support! It has been so validating and encouraging through all this so thank you all. <3

Last night I spoke to my husband about how I was feeling and that I want to go to couples counseling together and he agreed. I have also wanted to go to therapy myself for a while, I’ve been struggling to find a therapist, but hopefully soon!

I have known that she’s been trying to reach out to him for the past few months, and I know he’s been messaging back. He’s been asking her for space and time to think and she has not been respecting that as her and her boyfriend continue to reach out. He sent a long message the other day trying again to end things with them but she would not stop messaging and asking to come back in his life. She has been wanting to talk to me again, but when I explain to her how she has hurt me, she denies everything. This is why I’ve given up on trying to work this out with her because she hasn’t respected our space, privacy, marriage, or peace, and she won’t admit to fault. I have seen their messages back and fourth so I have known they’ve somewhat been in communication.

I completely agree with everyone saying I should be prioritized as his wife, and I thank you all for validating that. I have had the thought that she might have feelings for him.  I didn‘t mention it in my original message, but she has made some sexual comments to him I thought were a bit odd. For example, on a trip my husband was on with her and her boyfriend, she made a comment about his long tongue saying he must be good at eating a girl out. I don’t know if I’m being dramatic, it just made me feel weird. I wasn’t there for this, my husband told me about this and how it made him uncomfortable. I think she probably has an unhealthy view of their friendship, and probably wants to be prioritized in his life.

I understand my husband is sad about losing this friendship, I believe he’s completely valid for feeling that way. I just don’t think it’s healthy for myself and our marriage if she’s around with everything that’s happened, and I feel our marriage should be protected first and foremost. I explained my feelings to him, and he agreed. He says he agrees that I come first in his life and he is no longer going to continue the friendship, and he sees how it isn’t healthy for us. I’m thinking maybe her constant reaching out and pressuring him is what made him change his tune, but I’m hoping with time he continues to understand where I’m coming from and my perspective throughout all this. He did send one final message to her saying that the friendship isn’t healthy and it needs to end for the sake of our marriage, then he blocked her. He promises that’s the end, so I’m hoping and praying that it stays that way. I really hope he understands where I’m coming from so he doesn’t resent me in the end for losing this friendship.

One last thing, something like this did happened with roles being reversed. We weren’t officially dating yet, just going out, so this was very early on. I had a friend of 7 years who was treating my husband poorly and saying mean things about him. I constantly defended him and stood up for him to her because how she was treating him wasn’t right. This was a habit of hers, she did this with all my boyfriends. I will add I’m my husbands first girlfriend so I don’t know if his friend would have treated other girls the same way or not. Anyway, my friend and I did have a falling out because she said some really mean things to me, but I do believe that if we weren’t fighting so much over my now husband we probably would have been able to patch things up. Loyalty and justice are super important to me and I always want to support and protect those I care about.

I think that’s everything, hopefully she stays out of our lives and our marriage can grow stronger from this. Again, thank you so much for taking the time to read and comment! It has encouraged me so much!

Much love and God bless!

Me and my partner have been together for 6.5 years and we have had ups and downs from the little things to a rocky start with infidelity on both ends. Regardless I truly believe we built a relationship to be proud of being in such a long-lasting relationship starting at a very young age and this girl is really something special. 

About 7 months ago she came forward in wanting a break from what we had as she has an extremely demanding job and felt there wasn’t enough energy to fix what we had and thought growing independently was the answer, to which I take the responsibility, I worked a shit job during nights, didn’t take on dates, and wasn’t there for her and overall was in a mental rut for too long which I was actively trying to change. 

About three months go by and I gotten a better job and was actively bettering myself in the gym, motivated, and all that jazz. We decide to date again for the last 3 months everything was going great, found quality time for each other and the new dynamic living apart was working so well up until I found out about the real reason for the break 

I had found out that over the break she had slept with a co-worker at one of her jobs through messages over her phone and that they were in regular contact, not necessarily inappropriate as of the last 3 months but still in regular contact. once confronted about it she had explained that in top of what she explained before the break she felt as though she wanted to explore what it felt like to be with someone else and see if a serious relationship is for her at that time, she then said it showed her that it isn’t what she wanted and regretted it and made her realize the experience made her think of what she had and she’s never wanted to build our life together more and never loved me more. I do believe that part with the effort she’s been putting in and how well it’s been working. 
To an extent I can understand her feeling towards seeking what she did, especially because we been together so long since a young age. I did at one point, and I cheated years ago in that same feeling. 

Where my big issue was with this is, they had to see eachother regularly and even once outside of work to complete other work. though she stopped what they were doing together once we decided to date again she was in contact with him still and (plot twist) the sex they were having was very kinky and even the back door and all that. to which we never done and not to say ours was plain vanilla but you get what I mean. I’m going to note that she came forward that she said she was uncomfortable with what happened and for some reason was scared to say no. 

Whatever the case, I can’t seem to shake that imagery out of my head and I feel as though I won’t be able to look at her sexually the same. 
It took her for me to find out to create strict boundaries with him. she since quit that job and blocked off all contact with him but again I can’t shake what happened between them. 

Its one thing to hear your girl say she had a quick drunk hookup but the idea of what happened is eating me alive. idk if this is a ego thing of mine or what, How would you delegate this? I need desperate help lmfao",1749612786.0,,1749614118.0,False,True,N/A,,False,True,False,False,False,0.83,N/A

I feel shattered and completely alone. I recently had a miscarriage, and what happened before and after has left me questioning everything about my relationship.

To give some context: I found out I was pregnant while I was already grieving the loss of a very important family member. I’d also had a miscarriage at the end of last year. Emotionally, I was already at one of the lowest points of my life — trying to stay hopeful, trying to survive the grief.

At the same time, I’ve been in the middle of preparing for a huge life change. Going from living in two places to just one — I’m currently packing up my entire life to move with my husband — giving up a newly chosen career path, everything I love, and the state I’ve been building a life in. I’m forfeiting everything I care about right now, for this move… and for him.

When we found out about this pregnancy, my husband and I agreed not to tell anyone. I needed to feel safe and protected. But weeks later, I discovered he had told his sister behind my back — and then lied to me about it for weeks.

Every time I asked him if he had told her, he denied it. Worse, he kept suggesting that I should tell her — even though she already knew — and acted like I was being unreasonable for wanting privacy. It was manipulative and disorienting. We fought about it several times, and he just kept gaslighting me — making me feel like I was imagining things or being overdramatic.

Then, a few days before the miscarriage, I started bleeding. I told him I was scared, because this is how my last one started. On Friday — a day I was emotionally fragile and physically in pain — I had heard from him in the morning, but throughout the rest of the day and night, he didn’t even shoot a quick text to check if I was okay. Not once. No call, no message, no presence. I ended up waking in extreme pain in the wee hours the next morning and had to be rushed to the hospital by ambulance.

A couple days after the miscarriage, we got into another argument about his sister. For two days, he twisted my words, denied things he had literally just said, acted confused, and refused to acknowledge anything clearly. I was already raw, my hormones were all over the place, and I was deep in grief. The first day of this, I completely broke down. I screamed, sobbed, and told him I couldn’t take it — that I needed space to think.

But the next day, it happened again. Same conversation, even worse gaslighting. Again, I screamed at him and cried. I could feel that I wasn’t crazy. And finally, that night, he admitted everything. He broke down, apologized profusely, and told me he had lied, that he had gaslit me, that he had told his sister everything weeks ago. 

Clearly, he had been posing as if we should tell his sister because he rationalized that she may have been of help and hoped I took the bait so he didn’t have to admit he had already betrayed me. Then anytime the question came up, he played psychological games with me to confuse and distract from his betrayal even while I was emotionally and physically raw. 

I don’t know what to do with all of this. The betrayal of my trust. The emotional abandonment while I was miscarrying. The manipulation when I was already at my lowest — grieving, hormonal, uprooting my life, and trying to hold everything together.

I guess I’m just looking for validation… or for someone to tell me I’m not insane. If you’ve gone through something like this — betrayal during deep grief, gaslighting in the middle of crisis — how did you begin to heal? How did you rebuild your sense of self?

Help. 


Edit to add: I couldn’t sleep for the past few nights from the stress after this information was revealed. I’ve been waking every hour or two with anxiety and panic and I’m supposed to be packing. I’m so weak and exhausted on every level. I’m struggling. 

I texted my sister in law (the one who knows) everything and I told her I wanted a break from relationship with the extended family for the time being. I feel very awkward and didn’t want to tip toe around the situation. I still feel awkward. I told her since her and her husband were in my marital business without my knowledge they may as well know it all now. She knows about my husband’s gaslighting and manipulation as well. I do feel a little relieved to air it but this should never have happened. ",1748384563.0,,1748386479.0,False,True,N/A,,False,False,False,False,False,0.91,N/A

We were together for a while, and during that time I stood by him through so much—especially while he’s been in a grueling nursing program. I’ve always tried to be supportive and understanding, even when I felt like I was the one constantly sacrificing.

But things started piling up. When I got really sick and needed to go to the ER, he didn’t take me. That moment hurt more than I can describe—I felt like my well-being just wasn’t a priority. He missed family holidays with me. He’d turn his head when I tried to kiss him. We didn’t share the little moments of intimacy that make a relationship feel alive anymore.

Every night, instead of cooking together and building our own little life, we went to his parents’ house for dinner. Every. Single. Night. I felt like I was living someone else’s routine instead of our own. I was slowly fading into the background of his life, and mine just revolved around him.

I always did all of the chores for him… I paid for grocery’s and helped pay for electric bill (his parents paid for his rent) and yet he still refused to let me live there. I always communicated how I felt, he told me I was too sensitive and needed therapy. And he said he was trying but I truly felt no effort at  all.

I tried to hang on. I wanted it to work. But the loneliness and neglect kept growing. So I finally packed up my things and left. It broke my heart to do it, but I thought it was what I needed to find peace and start healing.

The thing is… I still love him. I miss him every single day. I keep wondering if I did the wrong thing. If maybe I should’ve stayed, held on a little longer, been more patient. He wasn’t abusive or cruel—just emotionally unavailable and overwhelmed. But does that make it okay?

How do you know when you did the right thing versus just giving up too soon?

Over the course of our marriage, my (M30) wife (F31) has hardened her heart. She used to come over to my apartment when we were dating, thrilled to see me and me her. We moved in together, got engaged, and were deeply in love. We’d see each other after work and be absolutely thrilled to be back in each others arms. Then we got married. It feels like a switch flipped after we got married. I’d come home from work and get a nod and a “hey”. I tried hard to keep the romance alive, going so far as to have regular “emotional check-ins” (literally the words I used) to make sure we were on the same page with our feelings and relationship. At first she’d engage in these conversations but as time went by she withdrew more and more. 

I thought she was losing hope in our relationship so I tried to bring that spark back. Having flowers delivered to her at work, trying to plan trips and adventures and spa dates, taking more of an initiative in our home life. She got angry when flowers showed up even at our home, lamenting to me that they’re a waste. She’d complain about the cost of any trip or date I’d try to mention. If she was okay with the cost then the distance was the problem, even if it was under an hour away. Every time I’d mention something we could go do I was met with resistance, so eventually I gave up. 

Then I got a new job, started making more money. Suddenly she was happy again. I’ve never even thought she was interested in money. I’ve never had any to give so why would I think that? Things were good for a while. Our summer was fun, we went and did a lot of stuff. Farmers markets, massages, got a dog, and just enjoyed our time together. I came home from work and she smiled and kissed me and felt genuinely happy to see me. 

Then we decided to have a baby. We were both excited. The process had its ups and downs. We talked a lot and connected in a deeply emotional way. She took a test, was positive, and 6 weeks passed. We see the doctor and she had a miscarriage. We mourn together, consoling and loving each other as we lament what could have been. Then we get lucky and she’s pregnant. Our beautiful baby comes along a short 8 months later.  She had a very tough pregnancy in terms of her heath and I was with her all the way. Taking care of her, helping her, loving her, and worrying for her every single day. Our amazing baby girl arrives 5 weeks early and I’ve never felt closer or more in love with my amazing wife. She is as a goddess, dealing with the pain and recovering like a saint. 

I went back to work after just a few weeks. Not for long though as I accepted a new job for more even money. My wife was thrilled for the money and the fact I was working from home.

Then she went back to work. I know she hates her job. I used to work where she does, that’s how we met. But I left and she worked her way up the ranks. She climbed and climbed with very little to show for it. They disrespect her, mistreat her, and undervalue her at every turn. I tell her this, she knows it, yet she continues to stay there. 

Her attitude got worse. She’d come home from work and wouldn’t even smile at me. Then wouldn’t look at me, wouldn’t kiss me, didn’t even pretend to be happy to see me. She would spend nearly every minute on her phone. Whether it’s the dinner table, feeding out daughter, laying in bed, watching a movie, you name it. She spends more time looking at her phone than me. I try to talk about it and I’m lucky to get her to engage in the conversation. I’ve literally said “I feel like you don’t enjoy being around me anymore” and it would be followed by silence as she scrolls through Facebook. “Hey, did you hear me?”. Nothing but silence. Eventually I gave up.  

I don’t know what to do anymore. She won’t play with our daughter without scrolling through her work email, texting people, or looking at Instagram. She comes home from work and no matter what I do I can’t get her to smile at me. She takes every chance to dig at me, whether it be something I’m self conscious about, a vulnerability I expressed, or something utterly beyond my control; it seems we cannot have a constructive conversation. And believe me, I’ve tried. I’ve said to her “can we just talk? I feel like we aren’t as close as we used to be”.i get nothing more than a “don’t be ridiculous” as she continues to scroll on her phone. We go to bed together and I get a literally pat on the head as a goodnight most nights, while she rolls over, tells the dog how he is the most precious and wonderful thing in her life (direct quote), and then scrolls through her phone as I fall asleep. I’m sure there are things she wants me to say or do but I’m not a mind reader. I just simply do not know what to do anymore and I feel utterly and completely lost, unloved, and fundamentally unwanted. ",1742611620.0,,False,False,True,N/A,,False,False,False,False,False,1.0,N/A

I work the night shift, so while I tried to reset my schedule, I started feeling extremely tired by 7pm. I didn’t want to sleep on the couch in the living room because a lot of male family members were around whom I’ve only met max twice and he offered I sleep in his car, which also felt a bit unsafe due to me not knowing the neighborhood and being alone in the car.

So I was going to just be content with suffering with the rest of the night and was chilling in the garage where everyone else was. My boyfriend noticed how tired I was and after giving me the options of the couch or car, he ended up just wanting to take me home and then going back to the celebration himself. So this is where the problem starts. Once I got into the car with him, I off-handedly mentioned how I was glad to go home since I didn’t really want to go to sleep with all the men idk around since he wasn’t in the same room with me. He took offense to that, which I see as reasonable since it implies his family would do something to me, and we delved into a small argument as he drove me back home.

He said comments like “I didn’t expect that from you.” “You’re acting like your father.” (My dad has made ludicrous claims in the past about my boyfriends family which I do NOT approve of or ever have) which really hurt my feelings because I thought it was reasonable for a women not to feel safe sleeping around strangers and I wasn’t going to create any problems.

We have been together for 3 years, 2 of which we have been living in a rental apartment together. Currently we split all rent and bills equally. Our current arrangement is good in my opinion. Our relationship is generally great, with pretty normal ups and downs. 

We started discussing the future, and both would like marriage and children. I feel ready for marriage but my boyfriend is not currently ready for marriage. I’m willing to wait until I decide I cannot wait anymore. 

He has expressed to me that he wants to own a home separately from a spouse. His reasons are because his brother is going through a divorce and having difficulty keeping his home after an unfaithful partner. He also works in a field where he has been exposed to other people’s nasty divorces and petty arrangements. 

This arrangement gives me a bad feeling for different reasons including but not limited to: 
1) it’s feels like it would be a marriage based on distrust 
2) he’d have total control of the property and potentially my living situation

I still am not sure if I accept this idea, however I would like advice on what I should expect in order to secure myself financially. If we do ever get married and I don’t own the property, are there ways I can ensure he can’t just sell the house, decide to move, or kick me out if we have problems? 

I am also interested in your personal opinions and experiences with this type of arrangement.

104,2026/2/27,17: 8:59,1m8h4cm,relationshipadvice,I [30F] asked my husband [34M] about the cold sores I've gotten since we reunited,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationshipadvice/comments/1m8h4cm/i_30f_asked_my_husband_34m_about_the_cold_sores/,/r/relationshipadvice/comments/1m8h4cm/i_30f_asked_my_husband_34m_about_the_cold_sores/,17,Clairita462,46,"My husband and I were long distance for 1.5 years and were recently able to be reunited. I'd previously expressed insecurity about being away from each other because so many people talk / joke about how that leads to cheating, which he'd brush off saying how could I think something like that because I'm so beautiful etc., which is nice but also never left me feeling like I'd been able to have a serious conversation with him.

Since we've been reunited I immediately got a couple cold sores. I know that can mean anything - stress, or just us being reintroduced. So I waited until a casual walk out with our dog to bring it up. I said  
""hey, I've been feeling a bit weird about something.""  
""Oh? What's up?""  
""Well, you know cold sores?""  
""Oh yeah. How do you even get them?""  
""They're from kissing. From uhm, I can't remember the name, HPV- or something.""  
""Oh yeah, I can't remember the name haha. It's like- nope, don't remember.""  
""Do you ever have them?""  
""Rarely? No. My brother has?""  
""Your.. brother?""  
""Yeah remember that large cold sore he ended up getting surgically removed - wait no that was a cyst.""  
""So.. not a cold sore?""  
""No. I guess not, why? You had that cold sore recently right?""  
""Yeah. Actually it went away, but I got another one. I've been getting them just recently, since you arrived.""  
""So... what are you thinking?""

At this point I was bewildered because he seemed really nervous. I'd expected us to have a nice chat about how cold sores could happen any time. I frowned and asked ""Why.. are you acting like this?""

He stopped and said ""I feel rushed all of a sudden. I feel bad. I need a moment.""  
""...Ok."" I stood there with him, growing more concerned, because I thought this was going to be an easy conversation.

He indicated to continue walking and asked ""What's wrong?""  
""I don't know, I feel like you're... acting dumb.""  
He was silent again for a few seconds. Then he said:  
""I noticed that you received something in an official envelope like a medical test. At first I thought it was a Covid test. But it wasn't.""  
I felt completely blindsided by this question. ""My... pap smear?""  
""Oh... that's what it was. I put it in the bathroom""  
I took a pause and then said ""I'm going home."" I looked an saw that in order to see my pap smear, he had to open up my envelope, which I also felt a bit uncomfortable with.

I feel like we've been unable to have a serious conversation about our time apart, and in this I was hoping to be reassured about a small issue and simply get it out of the way. I don't really think I suspected him of anything before the conversation, but now I feel so conflicted. It feels like he was avoiding everything over nothing, and then tried to turn it around on me?

EDITS: (for clarification)

1. I had not had cold sores before. And no, I did not exchange fluids with anyone else (cheat).
2. Originally my goal in the conversation was more open ended. My full thought was ""hey I've been getting cold sores since you arrived, which I've never had, weird right?"" And then I was going to see his thoughts. My husband is also a nurse and I didn't know as much about cold sores (thanks for comments with info!) except that it was spread through kissing and could be dormant and many people had it.

I thought it was going to be more like he was going to say he'd had those in the past, or provide more info on them, or reassure me. I know it's hard from just the dialogue, but when I asked if he'd ever had cold sores was when he began to appear very nervous.

The ""Rarely? no. My brother has"" was said very rapidly, and he was talking fast until he said he felt bad and felt rushed. I started to feel a bit sick and confused because I didn't understand, and then when he mentioned the pap smear I went home.

EDIT 2:
Well, we figured we it out. I’m embarrassed now. I have canker sores, not cold sores. I didn’t know the difference and funnily enough, neither did my husband as a nurse. Canker sores are inside the mouth, and white or red and painful, while cold sores are usually around the outer lips in a collection and red and peeling. Mine are definitely the former.

He DID start panicking when I asked if he’d ever had cold sores because he currently has a mouth sore he was freaking out about. He’s worried it’s like his brother’s, and he doesn’t have health insurance. It’s inside his mouth and while and appears to be a mucocele, a hardened salivary gland that’s been growing over the past month. We also uploaded a pic to AI and it does appear to be that.

He said he didn’t really hear much I said after I asked him about cold sores because he’d been silently avoiding panicking about this until now. He said he brought up my pap smear because all he remembered about cold sore was “papolo” and he’d seen “pap” something on the letter, and said it out loud without thinking more about it. He said he hadn’t even considered that I was bringing up something that could be spread sexually and that he’d then reacted in a guilty way, and was horrified and apologized.

It also opened the doors to having a better conversation around our time apart and my insecurity. We’ve both had families broken up by cheating, which is partially why he’d been treating it lightly because he’s like but I would simply never do that. It caused so much damage in my life and I would never speak to that parent again. But we talked and teared up and it was nice.

Thanks for your thoughts and info on STI’s and my communication style. I’ll continue to think on some of these things like our communication, and probably get tested anyway just because it’s been like 6 years. :) have a good day",1753393110.0,,1753432650.0,False,True,N/A,,False,False,False,False,False,0.95,N/A

I went into this thinking the key to being a good girlfriend was being low-maintenance, understanding, and not starting problems over “little things.” He’s had multiple relationships before me, so I kind of assumed he knew what he was doing more.

So I wanted the “chill girlfriend.”

I don’t question him going out.

I don’t ask for constant reassurance.

I try not to “nag.”

If something bothers me, I usually sit on it and try to see his side first.

But lately it feel just lonely? Even though I have a boyfriend.

One of the main issues is our sex life. I don’t have a lot of experience, and he a little more, so in the beginning I just went along with things because I didn’t want to seem awkward or inexperienced. I thought it would just come naturally the more we did, but it hasn’t really.. Now it just kinda feels like a chore. Not because I don’t want to or have no sex drive. He doesn’t really ask what I like, and when I’ve tried to bring it up gently, he usually says “you’re too in your head about it.” Which I might be because I do get anxious sometimes which might affect how I’m feeling in the moment. If I’m not in the mood, he gets quiet and distant after, which I know is just like normal. He can go do something else, but I feel really bad about it. I can’t tell if this is just normal relationship stuff I need to get used to, or if I’m failing lol.

There’s also kinda a financial imbalance I feel bad about. I’m still in Uni and figuring my life out career-wise, and he has a stable job now. Which he’s very successful and I’m very proud of him. He pays for most things, but then makes  jokes about me being “expensive,” even though I don’t ask for fancy stuff. It makes me feel like I owe him. not just money-wise, but overall. So now I’m constantly trying to be extra easygoing, extra agreeable, extra “good,” because I feel like I have to make up for what I’m not bringing financially or sexually.

He comforts me a lot and says I overthink and that relationships aren’t supposed to be “that deep all the time.” After those talks, I always end up apologizing. It could just be a me problem and I need to contain my anxiety, or set up different boundaries, I just don’t know how to do that.

I’ve been with my partner [41M] for just over a year and last Christmas, this Christmas, and my birthday this man has gotten me some type of biofeedback device.

Last Christmas was a Fitbit charge 6 to help measure my sleep, activity, and HRV. I LOVED this present because I had been eyeballing them myself. I use it daily.

On my birthday this year, he got me a HeartMath device to help me to learn how to relax and help improve my HRV. While hesitant at first, I also ended up LOVING this gift. I use it weekly.

We just did Christmas gifts this morning. I’m currently in the bathroom getting ready for an event we’re going to together now so he has no idea I’m typing this or feeling weird. This Christmas gift was yet another biofeedback device. I don’t even know what it’s called but essentially you hold it like a computer mouse and it measures your hand sweat to see if you are stressed, and then you’re supposed to meditate or do something relaxing to control whatever response it is giving.

All of these things are super kind gestures, especially since I struggle with mental health and have a lot of past trauma. Although, I’m starting to feel like he’s going overboard with the biofeedback gifts and it feels like the only thing he can think of to get me.

I am a complex person with many interests, hobbies, aspirations, and goals. I am multi-faceted. I’ve always known him to be very understanding of me and I truly feel like he knows me well. Although, these gifts are starting to make me feel like he only sees me in one light. That light being someone who is mentally ill.

I will talk to him about it sometime in the weeks following Christmas. Today is not the day for it. But, I’m kind of feeling a little hurt. Appreciative, but hurt. I wasn’t expecting anything for Christmas so it’s not so much of disappointment that I’m feeling. Maybe what I’m feeling is that he might just see me as someone who is unwell and needs to get better, rather than a true equal or a partner in life.

Side note: I do a LOT of healing on my own. I’m medicated, therapied twice a week, exercised, and much much more. Things I all do on my own.

It went smoothly. She admitted she just hasn't gotten around to it yet. All good and we are going to come up with a plan for next year on the easiest way to do it! Thanks for the advice!

Update 2: I guess I have a follow up question now though... Do you think $100 is enough to contribute every year? Or should I be doing more? I will disclose that I fully have the means to do a lot more, but I don't know how to go about that, as that is an entirely different conversation.

A few years ago, I lost my best friend unexpectedly. He left behind a wife and a three year old at the time. For the funeral, in lieu of flowers, his widow asked for donations to a trust fund set up with the idea that it would be used for the child's post secondary education. I thought this was a great idea, since my friend never had the opportunity to attend college, and it was his biggest regret in life. His siblings also never had the chance, so he always told me how he wanted to see his kids go to school. We of course made a donation to this cause.

Before he died we basically had an open door policy at each other's houses, and even now his widow is still our friend, albeit we don't get to see her as much as when he was alive. And understandably she is slow to respond to communication.

As his kid's birthday rolled around each year, I thought that donation might be a good thing to keep doing. It wasn't a crazy amount of money ($100), but over the next 16 or 18 years it would add up to a decent contribution. So for the last few years that's what we did, was give her a card with a cheque made out to the fund, in addition to giving their child an actual gift to open (because lets face it, children don't understand trust funds yet). Each year I also made a point to mention the card and contents, as well as we'd be bringing a gift for the kid to physically open. She was always thankful and said it was ""sweet"". So it isn't a matter of not actually receiving the cards.

Fast forward to today, I have been getting a jump on my year end and was doing some bank rec's, and I noticed that the cheque never showed up in my cheque images. The child's birthday is in the summer, so I thought that was odd. I then dug deeper and saw that it has in fact not been cashed. So that led me to go back to last year and see it's the same result, cheque was never cashed.

So now I am at a loss as to what to do. She is a very humble person, so I know that if there was an issue with depositing, she likely would not ask for a new cheque or help with it, so my first inclination was to reach out and make sure there were no problems. Then I had got thinking about it, and wondered if there was a different reason for it, that she does not want to accept it? But if that was the case, I guess I would still like to know so that I am not awkwardly giving her cheques in the future. I'll admit that the ""closeness"" and open door policy we shared seems to have died with my friend, but we still always get together fairly often since she is still a part of the friend group. There is also the chance that she does not know that personal cheques are only good for six months. I know that sounds terrible to say, but the dynamic that my friend had for controlling the finances, would very much have set it up for her not to know that type of thing.",1765220268.0,,1765223674.0,False,True,N/A,,False,False,False,False,False,0.92,N/A

We’ve been together for 12 years and married for 4. He’s never been a super touchy-feely or sexual person, but lately it feels like I actually freak him out. It’s gotten to the point where I’m starting to question how he sees me. He was out of state from Thursday to Monday for a TCG tournament, and I really missed him. I picked him up from the airport, dropped him off at home so he could decompress while I finished work, and I was so excited to see him that evening. I knew he’d be tired, but I at least hoped for some cuddles and kisses. He did cuddle, but only gave a couple tiny pecks and clearly didn’t want much physical contact. He also took the next day off work, so I hoped that after some rest he might be more affectionate. He went out to play a local game for a few hours, and when he came home I had dinner ready. Later, while getting ready for bed, I decided to be a little playful. I’d seen those silly videos of wives walking up to their husbands naked as a joke, and the husbands are always excited or amused. I thought it would at least get some kind of reaction from him. After my shower, I walked out naked, passed by him on the couch, and casually started talking. He looked at me, said “oh hey naked!” and then immediately averted his eyes and didn’t look at me again. I got nothing. I didn’t push it and just went to the bedroom. I got dressed and as he was also getting ready for bed, I playfully tugged on his shirt and said, “let’s go to bed.” He genuinely looked fearful, did this exaggerated yawn, and said he was “so tired.” That moment made me feel awful. Why would me being flirty make him react like that? He struggles to talk about this. He either shuts down, gives no real answers, or refuses to discuss it at all. I want to be clear: I have never and will never pressure him for sex. I barely even try to initiate anymore because the rejection hurts so much. The frustrating part is that I’ve recently lost a lot of weight, I’m taking much better care of myself, and I finally feel confident and happy with who I am. And yet I feel invisible to my own partner. He says he’s attracted to me, but it’s getting harder to believe. Can anyone else relate?

We’ve been together for 2 years now. He introduced me to his family, big dinner, everyone dressed up, his parents clearly proud of their son (at least that’s how it looked to me). They were all talking business, real estate, the kind of world where everything is about success. I have nothing against that.

When they asked me what I do, I told the truth: I work with an animal association, rescuing and caring for them. This is my thing, my life. I can’t live with animals at home, but I spend my days with them.

They smiled politely, but I felt like they didn’t care. Not one follow-up question. Just back to their deals and investments. Crazy, right?
And he… had no reaction.

Since that moment (two weeks ago) everything feels weird between us. We don’t laugh together, no sex, no connection. Everything feels dead.

I don’t want to chase him. I love this man, but I don’t even know if he still loves me.

I [18F] have been living with my boyfriend [18M] for about two years now. At first our relationship was all about spending time and going places together around the country but now since we started being intimate a few months ago, its been feeling like thats all he has the energy to do. I try to be the best at giving everyone in my life an equal amount of personal space and attention when they need but my boyfriend isnt always the best at reading a room. Lately i haven’t been as interested in being intimate as he is and i can tell its taking a toll on his behavior and how hes feeling. To be honest once we started, since we live alone together, we have done “it” at least twice a day, once at night and once in the morning. This can be lessened with our schedules and whats going on but thats the most common amount. Recently i took a trip away for a weekend to visit friends in the city but ended up having a poor time and told him about this. His response was genuine and lots of “i miss you”. He said how he will wait at the airport for me and pick me up to get food after but once we got to the car he rushed to go home because he “just couldn’t wait to do me” and he needed it as he “hadn’t been pleasured all weekend.” Obviously i wanted to satisfy him and make him happy but it seemed strange to want that first thing when he knows i had a bad weekend and was still hung up on it. Once we got home though thats when things got concerning. We had been intimate like he asked but after we watched an episode or two of a show he asked again. I said “sorry im really tired from my flight (8 hours by the way) and i just wanna chill and go to sleep honestly” I could tell he was disappointed but i expected that from him as he missed me a lot but what i didnt expect was him being passive aggressive towards me for the rest of the night. Giving me one word answers, turning over and not holding my hand anymore, and even leaving to go to bed early because he “was tired too” even though he did nothing that day but pick me up. I let it go though because i didnt want an argument as i was running on about 3 hours of sleep and one shitty airport lunch but this progressed to the next few days as well. Just this morning, (for context we each have a separate room with all our stuff in it but we will sleep together in either) i ended up sleeping in “my room” with the door closed and locked as i had just done my skincare and didnt want him coming and kissing it all off my face. I woke up to him picking my lock and opening the door asking to watch a movie with him on the couch. I said yes but only if he would make me breakfast laughingly and he agreed. But once we came out to sit he just wanted to kiss me and asked to be intimate again. I told him sure and subtly asked to be short because i was tired but i was still in the mood. He said of course and after we were done we got through about 3/4 of the movie when he asked to kiss, then to cuddle, then he started pulling my pjs off me. I stopped him and said “i love you but im just not in the mood like i said. We can do it later but i want to cuddle and watch tv right now okay?” At this point i felt like i was being rude or disrespectful towards him as he became passive aggressive again and turned away. I said i was sorry and he just asked if we could do it quickly again and i repeated myself nicer. Then I said “Do you wanna get up and eat breakfast then later maybe?” He just looked at me and went on his phone. Everytime he says he’s hungry i always offer to make him food even if i know he wants take out, I always try to make him things because i know how important it is to do the little things that make people happy for no reason and it matters just as much to me so when he did this i felt hurt. I then asked again and he walked away to his room and i said “please could you just make breakfast and we can talk” and he said “Do you really need a waffle?” When he said this it just felt like all i had done for him was not seen as endearing but just something i should do anyway and as a requirement. I give him intimacy, and i serve him how he wants. Thats it. At least how he made me feel. He did end up making me the waffle, but in complete silence. I gave him a kiss and gasped when he gave it to me trying to show i wasn’t upset and i was very grateful he made it for me still, but all he gave me was a few looks and he went to take a shower.

Im just wondering how i can fix this situation and if im being stubborn about how we do things. So far we haven’t been fighting but its just been quiet. I do like being intimate with him but sometimes 2-3 times a day can be too much for one person to want. Personally i feel like its unhealthy for someone’s desires to be met every time they are feeling them but im not sure. Im never too busy for him but i just feel like hes only been asking for one thing and its making me feel bad and he wont listen to me. 

Thank you for reading.

This post is getting more attention than i thought it would so please read carefully: Please no reposting this or talking outside of this thread. If he found out this was about us it could hurt our relationship or make things here worse. Thanks so much.


EDIT: 


After ive gotten a lot of advice i spent my day without him somewhat and i have some news to share. The beginning of the day we got food together and when out for an hour or two then i went out with my friends for about three or four hours. He knew about this all day and i had told him i was excited before it all. Right after i had left and was in the car with them he had texted me “i miss you” and asked when id come back. He texted me a few other times but my phone was dying so i had to ignore them to not lose battery right before going out. My phone ended up dying anyway and once i was able to charge it i opened it up to texts of him getting upset i didnt text back and how i hadnt said i miss you and i love you back to him (i did when in the car but not while i was out because my phone was dead) then once i cleared this with him he said he was sad and missed me all day. 

I have seen and watched the videos youve all sent in the replies and i sent one to him asking if it was accurate and to let me know if it would help me understand his urges. He said he did see it but it was “too long to watch” and said maybe hed use chatgpt to summarize and get back to me. Honestly it feels like hes not taking me seriously in my concern with our relationship and it frustrates me. I tried to point this out in the moment and he made jokes about the people making the video and brushed it off. Its now the end of the day and still no reply to my video so i dont think he ever watched it. 

Still going through this but thank you guys for your replies and advice :)  i will update soon.

I am a work from home guy working in IT. Hence, I tend to stay home most of the days. I do go outside, do grocery shopping and visit my mother-in-law. I also do most of the house chores because due to my availability, it is easier for me.

We've been in a relationship for 11 months. We moved in with my girlfriend around three months ago after we went through a pregnancy which was not planned yet it definately was not disliked. Nonetheless it ended in a miscarriage.

After that, she still decided to move in with me. I had just moved to a small house while all that was happening so when she moved, my things were still in boxes. We both organized the house together. We both accomodated the things for living comfortably with each other.

She has always been quite the ""lone wolf"" type. Dislikes meeting new people, does not want to be around others and even with me she has quite clear boundaries; nonetheless she has been quite loving and serious about the relationship.

Now she says to me that she is feeling quite desperate because she has no alone time. She is barely alone in the house because I am mostly here. I work from here, I draw and paint from here, I like being here. Nonetheless she has her own studio and I have mine. She also works as a University teacher, so is not like she has much alone time at work either.

I feel quite conflicted because while I can understand whe the need for lone time comes from, I am starting to feel like I need to come up with artificial reasons to go outside. I do have friends but they also work during normal schedules and I go to study Friday nights and all of Saturday. But I sincerely have no reason to just go outside, much more when that means spending money on coffee and stuff which I sincerely would prefer to do from home.

Also, most of my working equipment is heavy, so moving it to other places is a bit cumbersome for me.

She tells me that she does not feel like the house is hers. That she likes missing me and that a couple of hours without me in the house is not enough.

I feel like perhaps her take on solitude is not that compatible with me, much more understanding the kind of job and lifestyle I have. I believe I give her time to be alone in her room and I don't talk to her constantly. I would like to know who is more on the extreme to know perhaps if it is too unreasonable of me to feel that going out like that is a slippery slope into a distant-type of relationship where individuality is valued too much (not really my goal); or if what she is asking for is completely normal and I should put some effort to actually leave the house even if I have nothing to do.

Until now, we have been quite clear communicating. She does not like talking much but we have been respectful in the relationship al throughout.

She says she wants to be a famous popstar but never writes songs or tries to network or meet new people. She has no drivers license and relies almost solely on me to drive her around, again spends no time trying to get her license with her parents.

Main point of the story, I'm trying to go to college and she thinks we're going to live together in an appt off campus (keep in mind she isn't going to college or any kind of school) I definitely messed up by agreeing to it right away, but whatever. My parents told me that that isn't going to happen and is simply a terrible idea. I'm afraid to bring it up because I think she has the biggest victim complex imaginable, nothings ever her fault and everything happens to her and she just has no agency in her life. I really love her and want to be with her and no one is telling us to split but I can't see any other paths if she continues to just waste her days at home doing nothing, relying on me or her parents to cook, provide, and chauffer her around. It seems really unfair to her to just bring an ultimatum like ""you need to act like an adult or we can't be together"" just out of the blue.

She says and acts like I'm the only positive thing in her life atm, and she thinks she's a mature person but really just is not, but I can't bring it up without causing a fight and its easier right now to just not. I also worry that if any of this does come up and if we do end up splitting over this that she would hurt or kill herself (she struggles immensely with mental health).  
I just don't know how much longer love alone can carry this relationship and wtf to do if she never changes.

The note said, ‘Call me.’ When I asked her about it, she explained that the Sergeant had actually written the note for her to pass along to her friend (who’s also a nurse at the prison).

For a few hours she didn’t want to talk, but eventually she explained why. She told me that the captain at her prison job had been trying to flirt with her for quite some time—something she had never mentioned to me before. She claimed she always told him she was in a relationship and turned down his advances.

She said the issue started when she confided in her friend (the same nurse I mentioned earlier) about the captain’s behavior. According to her, the friend got upset and confronted the captain. The captain supposedly told her friend that he and my girlfriend actually do flirt with each other, which my girlfriend denies. She told me she believes the captain was just using her as a pawn to upset her friend, since her friend has been romantically involved with him for a while.

When telling me the story, she seemed especially mad at the fact that she felt like she was being used as a pawn.

Also she has been hanging with a few other females who work at the job. I overheard one of her friend say to her, “I thought you said you were done with him” referring to me.

My girlfriend [34F] of three years and I had just started looking at apartments when my parents surprised me: instead of waiting to pass down my inheritance, they’re giving me a lump sum to buy a place outright (likely a condo). The home would be in my name only, since my parents won’t take ownership and my girlfriend can’t contribute significantly to the purchase.

I want her involved in the search even though the property will technically be mine. My thinking is she wouldn’t pay rent but we'd split utilities equally.

Are there pitfalls I'm not seeing? She’d be giving up her studio, so if things went south she’d need to find a new rental—but this will also be significantly cheaper for her than renting.

We were both virgins going into marriage and we'd talked about our sexual history (how we were exposed to knowledge of it etc) in the 3 years we've been together before marriage. I think we made a mistake not consulting anyone about this before our marriage, though, because of our current problems. 

My husband's first exposure to the idea of sex was when he was \*six\*. His parents didn't realize he had come into their room, whilst they were watching p\*rn and.... other things no child should see their parents doing.   
He began an addiction to it very early.   
He stopped after we got together because he felt like it was causing him to view me as an object.   
My first experience was also very young,... after a family friend almost did very bad things to my sister and I. He did get to do some things, just not all the way... pardon if that sounds childish I just can't really bring myself to talk in depth about it even still after therapy. 

This caused me to have an underlying disgust, and kind of an ""it means nothing"" ""It only causes pain"" outlook on it.

We did have premarital counseling, but we both felt better about our mindset towards sex the closer we got to our wedding so we didn't bring up our pasts. 

  
Now that we have gotten married, I have found out that I have severe pelvic floor issues. I am going through therapy (mental and physical) to move past it. But it's causing my husband to be frustrated more often than not. 

He is by no means an insensitive man. But he does have occasional moments where he doesn't think before he speaks. He has autism and Asperger's syndrome (high functioning.) So there is almost a language barrier if you will, sometimes. 

The other day, he asked why we haven't attempted trying again (After several painful attempts during our honeymoon that left me in tears and feeling less than human.) I explained that I am trying to work on my pelvic floor issues so that I can be more comfortable whilst trying, because I don't want to associate him with pain. (especially after my prior experiences early in life.) He responded. ""Well, it is going to hurt anyway. Might as well try to get used to it.""   
I had to walk away. Saying something like that is very out of character. Normally, he takes his time and thinks about how things can be taken before he speaks. When I came back I asked him if I was just supposed to ""deal"" with the pain so that he had an off (which I'd like to mention I am not at all depriving him in any other area) He said that from what he understood that it will most likely be painful for me for months and maybe even years and that he didn't think I was really going to wait that long for us to try again. I told him I did want to wait just a few PT sessions more. Because I am making good progress and even my therapist is happy with the speed of progress.   
  
I guess the advice I'm asking for, is that some of my friends recommend we go and see a counselor about our situations before marriage.   
Others say that he's right and that it will most likely be painful for me for a very long time.   
and this is already causing issues, so if I try to just remember he isn't trying to hurt me, I should try to just push through. 

Yes I grew up in a very religious home, I was homeschooled and had no education on ANYTHING.  
He was the exact opposite but was too self-conscious to make any moves before marriage.

I am at my wits' end. It feels like nothing I do is enough for him, because I do things that I don't really feel comfortable with in order to try to make it up to him, yet he still complains that things are not like he expected. I have braces, and it makes anything with my mouth, including kissing, very painful, and I get frustrated that he doesn't seem to realize everything I am doing to try to please him. My desire levels are extremely low. Which has caused him to treat me more like a prostitute, I feel like, more than a wife. Because once he's happy, he disappears. It has gotten so bad that he basically ignores me until he wants something and then goes back to ignoring me once he's gotten it. Which is also not like him.

We've had several conversations. It gets better for a day or so, than goes back to how it was before because he sees friends of ours announcing pregnancies etc, and he says he is jealous.  I love him dearly and I know he loves me and just struggles with communication. I want kids more then he does, so I try to explain that I really do want to be able to do this and its just as frustrating to me that we havent been able to. But he doesnt seem to believe me. My self-confidence is at an all time low, and I feel like less of a person not being able to do this easily.

My boyfriend and I have been dating for a year and two months now. We met first year of university. I’ve always enjoyed reading novels from a young age (mostly romance and fantasy romance) but now I can’t stand them cause anything involving love seems so fake and scripted like it can never be real like guys aren’t capable of loving. I’ve only been in one relationship before him and he had never been in a relationship before. Things started out okay and they still kinda are but here and there I always feel unloved and like he doesn’t really put in any effort.

I’ve brought up my concerns and he got really angry and frustrated with me cause he said I was always telling him how much I appreciated him and how he’s always there for me (which is true). I told him I felt that way because he never really went all out or did any romantic gestures. He’s never gotten me flowers before or even chocolate. I even gave him an example of how he got the girl he had a crush on flowers for her birthday but nothing of that sort was done for me. He took me to some fancy restaurant and I covered half the bill on my birthday (while we were dating). The argument ended when I convinced myself I was wrong for feeling that way and wanting more and apologised. 

I’ve just been telling myself to be grateful he’s emotionally available and to try to be an understanding girlfriend. It’s been a few months since and the feeling has been resurfacing. Of course all this has been from my point of view but I’d really like some help with what to do. It all makes me think he doesn’t value me at all and that he’s not even putting in effort.

at the beginning of our relationship, he used to make me feel ashamed of my music tastes and other special interests (clothes i liked, books i read, etc). i let it all go at the time because i think i had gotten used to being belittled (and also had very very low self esteem) but i’ve gotten much more confident since then and he’s also apologized. i’m no longer feeling ashamed of finding joy in things and being excited about them and i’m really proud of myself for that. however, he still manages to hurt me with his words pretty often through little digs and put downs. i’ve expressed my feelings about this behavior and we’ve been in couples therapy for years but his actions never match all the promises he makes. 

it boiled over into me recently asking him why it seems so hard for him to be nice to me, and he got really sad that that’s how i view things. he was really apologetic and it felt like we had a breakthrough, but since then, he’s “jokingly” belittled me multiple times and then got upset that i had the gall to be upset with him about it. i don’t know what to do. he’s even encouraged me to stand up for myself against him - wants me to “call out his behavior so he can correct it” - but then gets upset when i actually do. i’m so confused. i know he’s aware of how negatively this is affecting our relationship, and he’s discussed it in his own private therapy sessions and made plans to improve this habit of self-inflation through put downs. in fact, he’s been able to quell this habit in regards to his friends and family, but not with me. he’s grown so much in so many ways but this issue persists. why does he keep doing this to me?

It’s my first serious relationship, and I really do love her. She shows me a lot of affection, and I don’t question that she cares about me.

We’ve had issues in the past when I’ve tried to talk about things like this, and I’m scared this will just be another fight. Still, I need some outside perspective, because I feel really stuck.

Mia has a very close gay best friend (I’ll call him Joe). They’ve been friends forever, and I know they’ve been through a lot together. What I struggle with is how close they are, physically and emotionally, so much so that it often feels like they’re in a parallel relationship. Examples:

•They often sleep in the same bed. Just last night, she went to a group sleepover I couldn’t attend, and later told me she and Joe shared an air mattress in another room.

•	She’s cuddled him in front of me before, and I assume they do when they share a bed.

•	She once pecked him on the lips in a group setting “as a joke.”

•	She has told me multiple times that he’s a handsome guy.

•	She’s brought up (more than once) a “lavender wedding” pact they have/had before me basically, if neither of them ends up with someone, they’ll just marry each other. Supposedly as a joke.

•	and small stuff, she recently called me his name multiple times in one day, I just see him touching her arm slowly and when I looked up he stops … a lot of her posts on Instagram literally have just photos of him or them together. People think they are dating when the see her ig.

I want to be really clear: this is not about jealousy or homophobia. I genuinely like Joe. I have several gay and bi friends and zero issue with her having close friendships. But from the beginning of our relationship, I’ve communicated that physical intimacy (like cuddling, kissing, sleeping in the same bed) is something I reserve for romantic partners.

Last point, if I did half the stuff she has done with our mutual lesbian friend, I know it would not go over well.

TL;DR:

GF cuddles, sleeps in bed, and kisses her gay best friend. I’ve set boundaries before, but it keeps happening. Now I feel like the third wheel and I’m scared to bring it up again.

Any advice is appreciated

**Edit:** Thank you all for your advice, I do love her so much and really hope we can work this out.

It seems to me that the next step is to have a talk with her and explain where I’m coming from and that I can’t stay if it’s going to keep happening, if she fights back or downplays my feelings I know what I must do.

To begin with, please don't hate on me. I am coming from a place of understanding and to do better. I just don't know what to do.



Me and my girlfriend met here on reddit 2 years ago and we instantly clicked. It was chemistry I never felt before and it grew. In the early months I figured from the way she talked that something happened in her past that had impacted her. When we grew closer, she told me she was sexually assaulted growing up and has been to/was going through therapy for it. I was there for her and since I knew, I was always super careful and sensitive around any sexual subject we would talk about. We fell in love and as she became more comfortable with me, she opened up sexually too. Turned out she was hypersexual and very open to kinky sex and that was like a dream come true. Until, 3 weeks ago.



Her therapist told her that she needed to re-live her assault and tell the story to someone for her to heal properly. It was also a prerequisite for EMDR. She discussed reliving it with me. I was hesitant and asked her if she really really thinks she has no one else to talk about it with. She said she didn't and one day, we sat down and she told me everything. And that is when everything broke down for me.



The assault was by her uncle who was only 7 years older than her. It started when she was 7 up until 3 years ago, when she was 32. It was never really forced and she was groomed into it, to the point that she would call him up to have sex. The sex was everywhere, anywhere and like two rabbits going at it. I couldn't bear asking for details but this is what she told me. They had sex even after he got married and he had kids. No one suspected because of the Uncle-Niece relation.



I don't know what to feel and what to do. I know she was groomed, that it was not her fault and that she could not recognize this was an unhealthy situation. But since I got to know the details, that it continued till a few months ago when we met, that it was never forced and that she continued to go back again and again, my mind cant stop feeling guilt and being mad at the same time. I don't know whether all her sexual fantasises are hers or someone else's, that all this hypersexuality might be a product of her past, and that she may have been a whole different person if this hadn't happened. I feel like I took advantage of her too, even thought I did not know. I am also unsure because, thinking back, whenever she talked about anything, she made it sound if she's never ""tried"" it and that all it is new to her and her fantasy. But as she re-lived the story, I realized she's done all that and more in the past.



All of a sudden, its like I don't know this person. I am also angry why didn't she stop it? As a kid, she wouldn't have know but, she said, at the age of 16, she realized all this was not normal and was wrong. Yet nothing changed.



I feel like I would be evil and a terrible person if I leave now. I don't know if I would be able to stay anymore either. I might need therapy but I don't think it would help our relation. I didn't bat an eye when I got to know she was SAed and provided her all the emotional support she needed, but the details have just crushed me now.

I know the answer everyone is going to give here is to leave, obvs, but I'm just wondering if anyone has a different perspective, their own story, or advice that wont leave me more depressed than I am. I do love him with everything I have. 


Ill try and sum up without a full essay but no guarantees:
We got together in college. Same interests, wanted to get married, have a kid maybe, his aspirations were high, came from a seemingly well to do fam, and i came from poverty, first of my fam to go to college. We hit it off extremely well, things were good. I had major depression from my home life and we were not financially stable enough to move out until years into our relationship. He stood by me through all my bullshit, and I through his. 
First relationship trouble started with him claiming to have pain during sex, which the first year was fine, this popped up out of nowhere. I asked him to see a doctor, no, of course he wouldnt. So we stopped having sex. I was low-normal drive, and we were super busy all the time, so it didnt matter a ton... but basically anything sexual completely stopped. He always had an excuse like it was college stress, then work stress, then bc we were still living at parents, to us getting our apartment and more work stress. 


5 years in we finally finished all his college with a masters and my bachelors, and at this point we set up a cruise trip to congratulate ourselves. I had been asking him about the doctor this whole time, and we had decided at this point we werent having kids bc neither of us could handle that, but I still very much had wanted to at least be married. Up until this point, I walked on eggshells bringing it up. It was never the right time, we had all these milestones he wanted to complete... etc. I had tried to talk to him about it before the cruise, and was hit with more blockades. This was finally irking me bc after 5 years I was hoping for anything to look forward to in our relationship past being forever bfs and gfs. 
So...My friend kind of invited herself on our cruise with her fiance. My bf agreed and didnt seem bothered. Honestly at that point i was upset and needing someone else around, too. Skip to the middle of the cruise and i admitted i was depressed bc of how he acts whenever we talk about marriage, and he hit me with ""Well, I was planning on proposing to you on this cruise but you invited \[Friend\] along."" 


....that went well, if you can imagine.
Cue a big argument that eventually led to him just yelling we can go to the courthouse. 
...that went even better.
I told him in the heat of that to never bother proposing as I would tell him no at this point.


Whelp, he held me to that. Its been nearly 10 years since then. We still dont have sex. His pain issue disappeared sometime in the last few years, on the handful of times we did. We went to couples counseling for one session, and it turned into a whole session for him about how much he hates his parents marriage. He went to further counseling for that, and I didnt pry and he didnt talk about it to me, but nothing changed.
I know a big part of it is my own mental health issues that ive struggled with for far before him. I know ive had some breakdowns that have fucked with him. Ive been medicated for almost our entire relationship but i can never live down the first couple years i wasnt. I am finally at a position where i want to try my own therapy again, in the past ive had some awful therapists that made me feel like i dont deserve help. 


Im sorry this is long and the answer seems obvious, but our lives are complicated. I cant really leave, with our pets and lives being this entangled. I know now after all this time he is definitely Ace. I know he is depressed from his life not going how he envisioned (thanks, early 2000s college aspirations). I know I'm tired of saying ""my bf"" to my coworkers as a grown ass woman in a relationship longer than most of them.

We were in an intermittent LDR (military) for 2-3 years before we moved in together and during that time, when he was around, we'd spend the weekends going on dates, interacting with each other the whole time and having fun. his room and truck were always neat and tidy. I felt safe and cared for when I was with him. and when he was gone, I understood it wasn't his fault that we couldn't be around each other so I didn't mind. 

when we moved in together, in hindsight, it almost seem like the trial period ended and my husband wasn't quite how he was when we lived separately. we never did date nights or made efforts to spend quality time together. he didn't help with chores or cooking. things I believed I didn't have to worry about because I had seen examples previously that made me think we were on the same page. most of our time together after 2017 would be spent in front of the tv.

 in addition to those issues, a big issue has been the amount of hours he works (no longer military now).  he has the option to decrease his workload over a period of time but in all honestly, he really just loves his job and I don't think he wants to give up responsibility. his normal day is supposed to be 8 hours but he usually spends at least 10-14 hours at work and at times will spend closer to 18 hours there. there have been a handful of times where he didn't come home at all or came home in the wee hours of the morning just to leave at 0530 for his normal shift. 

from 2017-22 I brought these issues up periodically and was always calmed with claims of doing more chores/cutting down hours in the future but it never really happened. I brought up couples therapy a few times but he's very private and pretty much said no without saying the word no. times where I have escalated the conversation because he wasnt engaging enough for me to get a satisfying answer, he either shuts down completely and stops talking to me or he'll leave the house for hours. the next morning/when he comes back, we would just pretend like nothing happened and wouldn't address the issue.

despite this, I feel like he's still objectively a good partner. he's kind and wants to financially support me and he's dedicated/reliable. so in 2021 after being engaged for 6 years and years of our families and friends hounding us about a wedding, we got married.  I feel very guilty because I had these thoughts before we got married. when I had talked to my mom before the wedding, she convinced me that these were normal thoughts everyone has. just wedding jitters. I didn't want to throw away a decent relationship just because I might be overreacting about my otherwise stable relationship. I brought up couples therapy again before the wedding which he agreed to, but was never actually available for prior to the wedding date.

I started an intense high stress job in 2023 and my husband was supposed to be the one that took on the primary household management role and taking care of the dogs while his work was supposed to take a back seat (this was always the plan that both of us had agreed on our entire relationship). however, the transition never really happened. now we're both out of the house constantly and I no longer have the energy to put into chores, myself, and our relationship. 

now that I stopped keeping things afloat, our relationship has significantly suffered in the last year. we haven't been on a date or been intimate in that whole time. the house is constantly a mess which puts us both in a bad mood. our dogs are never as well taken care of as they should be. I think he has been feeling me pull away and I think he is trying to deliver on what hes promised to work on in the past. he does try to come home from work on time sometimes or take initiative to clean the house. but it feels a little too late now - like I had to lose all affection for him before he took it as a sign to do something. not the times I brought up how I was feeling unloved or suggested therapy. 

so now, I'm genuinely thinking that I'm ready for this to be over. there's no way I can endure a relationship like this for the next 40-60 years and I don't know if it's possible/if I want to fix it. but people I've talked to about it have told me that I have to at least give him the opportunity to make things right by seeking help with a counselor or therapist. but sometimes I do think even if he could change overnight and do all the things that I've been asking him to do, I don't know if it would be enough to make me want to stay anymore. how would therapy even help if we're at this point? I'm worried we're both just settling. I know I should have been louder about my feelings all these years instead of letting my concerns be waived away or being worried about upsetting him. but I know I can only make choices from this point going forward now.

Me and my partner  have been in a relationship for a year now. While we do have an active sex life , one thing he's always wanting to do is Anal. I was interested in it too and gave it a try . At first he was very gentle , asked me if I'm good and all the normal stuff. After a while I even decided to get a butterfly plug since I know how much he likes it . I've always told him though , that this is not something I always want to do , nor really would initiate myself . I told him how much it hurts at the beginning and that I need to be really turned on so that I can even get into the  headspace of wanting that. 
Over the last few months I noticed a few things :
First off , I noticed that no matter how hard I try , we only have sex if he wants it. I'm talking about me putting on his favourite lingerie, setting the mood , massaging him and dropping the most obvious hints (I'm even telling him how badly I need him). It never ever works ...it's frustrating.  I know he doesn't owe me Sex and it's not everything I care about. He's a wonderful partner and always there for me. He brings out a better me , yet it's so down putting when I'm getting ignored like that . Even worse , he sometimes turns me on and promises me all those things just to leave me hanging. I told him it bothers me but he just starts rambling about how Sex is everything to me. I feel bad about myself since i do have a high libido but I don't always initiate sex , I really want to do it when I want to share my love with my boyfriend , not to only get pleasure out of it , I have toys for that . 
Second thing I noticed is that he usually only ever even starts to initiate it when talking about Butt stuff. I told him a lot of times that it's not something I always want to do. This keeps on happening and I'm starting to think there's something wrong with my Coochie. 
It's gotten to the point where even when we have sex , after he initiated it , that during it he's asking me if I wanna switch and I always say no but he ends up just doing it anyway , I quickly tell him to stop but he always says it's an accident .... 
Last night it was unbearable, I started crying immediately, telling him that it didn't just hurt me physically but also mentally.  I feel like my boundaries aren't being seen and he just cares about himself. I do give in a lot of times because I feel like otherwise he wouldn't touch me at all and it does sound desperate , but I like him touching me even if it's like that. I really need help , I don't have anyone to talk to...

So we were making out and he started to put his hands in my pants on my ass and I stopped him from putting his hand on my left ass cheek because I have a pimple and I put medication on it but I didn’t wanna tell him that. He listens when I say stop, and he only puts his hand in my pants on my RIGHT cheek, while the left is over the pants which is fine. 


He tries again eventually….that’s okay. I tell him to stop again, and he does. But he keeps his hand a little close to the entrance of my pants. Then he tries about 2 more times until I firmly tell him, “Stop.”


Then he’s like “okay okay okay” and he takes his other hand out of my pants, and pats my legs, like he’s trying to calm down or maybe signal me to get off of him, I’m not sure what the pats meant but that’s not the point right now. 


I get that he DID stop, but why did it take 3 times to tell him? He only had ONE hand in my pants, so he was WELL AWARE of what I wanted and didn’t want. Will this be a problem in the future? 


I know it’s very small & minute but I just need some outside perspectives because I’m also very sensitive when it comes to sexual assault so I’m not sure if I’m blowing this out of proportion or if it’s a real problem..


For some context, I took his virginity and he’s always been super respectful and almost hesitant when it comes to touching me. I’ve always appreciated it and would’ve never excepted this from him, even though it’s very small n I’ve been through worse… 


Will this be a problem in the future? 
How can i address this to him, if I even should?

to preface, im hypersexual due to a lot of sexual trauma i experienced in my childhood. my gf is the exact opposite, she doesn’t ever get the urge to have sex or even masturbate. when i attempt sexual advances, she turns me down even when it’s something like just making out. i’ve asked her before if she’s asexual or something but she tells me she’s just not in the mood or too nervous to have sex. 

i’ve talked to her about how not having sex is hard for me considering my hypersexuality and that while i respect her boundaries, i wish there was a solution. i’ve brought up the idea of an open relationship to her but she was utterly horrified at the idea. she tells me that i need to wait for her to initiate and be ready to have sex but it’s been 5 years of celibacy for me and it’s kind of driving me insane… i can’t even really masturbate to help because we live together and since she’s unemployed she’s always home when i am and i feel like she would be totally weirded out if i were to do that in front of her. 
i think she just expects me to tough it out but i don’t know if she realizes how hard it is on me. 
i’ve broken down in tears in front of her before about it but i end up feeling really bad because i can tell she’s so weirded out and disgusted by it . 

i’m just so lost on what to do though. i’m filled with so much shame, guilt and want but it feels like there’s nothing i can do. i don’t want to lose her but it feels like it’s almost unfair to me that i have to ignore this need. i feel like a disgusting freak though and i am constantly ruminating about sex. it’s been making me really depressed for years now but she’s still not ready..  i think this is one of those situations where i’ll just have to suck it up and deal with the possibility that we may never have sex but i thought id at least try to ask for advice.

I studied political science during my undergrad, and I’ve always cared deeply about social and political issues, especially corruption, injustice, and the abuse of power whether by governments, institutions, or other groups. It’s just the reality of the world. I keep up with investigative journalism, interviews, and news stories that reveal uncomfortable truths. I believe we have a responsibility as citizens to stay informed, even if we can’t fix everything ourselves. Awareness and discussion, to me, are the first steps toward change.

Sometimes, I bring up these topics in conversation, not all the time. But today, after I shared some things I’d read recently, we ended up in a big argument. He said I’m “too invested” and that I ruined our day together. I told him that I don’t think I’m invested enough—not when there’s so much happening in the world that goes unnoticed or unchallenged.

He’s more apolitical, and I respect but don’t like it. He also generally doesn’t believe the things I bring to him which is shocking to me and ridiculous. It’s even very triggering to me. I just want to talk about what matters to me like we talk a lot about his hobbies and his interests. I want to have meaningful, intellectual conversations and do our responsibility for a better society and world. Instead, I’m left frustrated and misunderstood.

Her form of OCD was that she thought God was constantly talking to her telling her to do things and reminding her of all the bad things that were happening in the world. Anyway since she found out she was pregnant she has been getting treatment for it, and for a while things were looking up. I don't mean to be selfish but for a while I felt like I could have my ""old wife"" back - she really wasn't really like this when we first got together. But it wasnt just for my sake I was hoping that with treatment she'd be happier herself and also be able to be there for our kids more. 

However, ever since Trump took office my wife's mental health has taken a turn for the worst. She has always been completely devastated about Palestine, but when she was at her job her job was a distraction from it, and when she got home and didn't have the distraction it was rough but she was actively working on being able to cope. However, when Trump started cutting funding for aid programs, she found out that the organization she works for would be doing layoffs and she might not have a job to go back to she completely lost it. Her coworkers were giving her updates from the ground, there were a lot of rumors, for a few days she was basically just curled up in bed texting, reading the news, and panicking. I didn't know how to support her during that time, nothing I tried to do for her made a difference, she didn't want the kids to see her in that state so she just kept telling me to go spend time with them, she left her room only once during that time to go to therapy. But then the day after that she left the house without telling me to go protest by herself by walking along the main road holding a sign. Luckily she did tell my best friend where she was going, and my best friend went with her and texted me what was up. At first I was just glad she was feeling well enough to get out of bed. 

However, now she does this more days a week than not, she spends more time doing this than she spends with our kids. I've gone with her a few times, my best friend goes with her a lot. Even if she wasn't protesting I'd be worried about her walking on that road, people drive really fast and aren't expecting pedestrians. However my other worry is that this is a very white and conservative area, a lot of people have guns, and my wife not only is out there protesting things that most people here agree with but she will actively shout at people who drive by with Trump stickers on their cars. There have been a few times when people will shout at her, a few people have pulled over to argue with her, and if that happens she doesn't try to deescalate or anything, she will scream back at them. She has asked a few times if our kids can come with her, I said no because I was afraid someone could hurt or threaten them, and she agreed not to take them. But when I mention that it would be just as horrible for our kids if they lost their mom and unborn brother because someone hurts HER, she brushes it off. No one has done anything physical yet, but there are some psychos out there and it only takes one.

She has also stopped doing therapy, stopped doing the workbooks her therapist gave her, and won't take her medication and didn't get her prescription refilled. She says that she doesn't think there is anything wrong with her, there is something wrong with all the people out there who AREN'T protesting. I asked her if she doesn't want to get better and be able to be happy and she says happiness isn't for her.

Another thing is that this is effecting our relationships with our neighbors. We were already ""odd"" in this area, we are not white and my wife is Muslim, we sometimes get looks and I've felt like I've had to ""earn"" acceptance from the neighbors. People will almost never be directly rude to us, but if I say ""My wife is a Muslim"" I can tell that what they hear is, ""My wife is a terrorist."" If I said ""My wife is a liberal Muslim"" that wouldn't go over much better. I've just kind of had to pretend I don't notice the reactions and keep being friendly until they decide my family is normal, I also try to always find a way to casually mention that my late mother was white and grew up in this area. However I can tell people are acting different around me now. A few people avoid me, some have awkwardly been like, ""So I saw your wife the other day"", I haven't been getting as much gig work, and worst of all, one of my son's best friend is no longer allowed to come over to our house. They outright told me, ""He can come over here, but I don't want him to go to your house anymore."" It felt like such a slap in the face, since I've babysat that kid so many times for FREE. 

Since Israel broke the ceasefire it's been at its worst, she has been out there every day for hours. I feel so heartbroken for my kids, who don't understand, and for my wife, who is her own worst enemy. I can't force her to get help, but I have no idea what else to do. She's at least been keeping up with her prenatal appointments, and she's promised me that when our son is born she'll stop protesting, but I almost don't know if I believe her because it almost seems like she's not capable of that.",1743901075.0,,False,False,True,N/A,,False,False,False,False,False,1.0,N/A

Before we had kids she was in college pursuing her career when we had a surprise pregnancy. After much discussion, we made the joint decision that I would co tine on my career path, and she would put hers on hold to raise our kiddos.

Because of her sacrifice, I was able to pursue my job and have success. It’s our shared success and I wouldn’t have been able to do it without her support.

We have three kids now in school and they have all been in school for years.

When our youngest was in pre-school, we began to discuss what she wanted to do with the extra time she would have on her hands. She debated going back to school, volunteering, or just being a “housewife” and she hasn’t really decided on anything.

Let me pause here to say that she has done a FANTASTIC job with our kids. They’re incredible and it’s because of her hard work. 10/10.

For the time being we agreed that she will be the “housewife” and that she would do the cooking, cleaning, laundry, child related things, etc.

Only the problem is… She HATES cooking, so if we want to eat anything besides frozen pizza, I cook. That means I have to meal plan, which means I do the grocery shopping and meal prep. Look, I actually enjoy cooking, but after a stressful day at work, I really just want to spend time with my kids and hear about their day. But instead I have to cook for an hour and then have to slam food down and start the bedtime routine.

She hates doing laundry so we have a constant laundry pile in our bedroom. I mean constant, our room never does not have laundry on the floor unless I put it away.

You want toilets cleaned? I’m your guy, otherwise, toilets won’t be cleaned. Floors cleaned? Yep, I’m your guy for that too.

I have expressed my frustration with this current setup for almost a decade with little to no improvement. I offer to help her learn more simple recipes, I offer to help her organize her tasks, I offer to remind her, etc. nothing helps. It’s the same fight every time. I feel like a piece of shit for bringing it up because gender roles gross me out. She feels bad because her ADHD makes these tasks really difficult. For anyone who doesn’t understand ADHD is not laziness, please do some research before commenting, that’s not what this post is about, I know she legit struggles with this and that is not her fault. Anyway, after the fight things will be better and more balanced for a week or so, and then we’re back to the same. Rinse, repeat. On top of that I take care of the cars, the yard, the house (things breaking).

I work from home and therefore I have a pretty good idea what she does with her time. It’s mostly breakfast, then a load of dishes, then a few hours on social media, then lunch, then maybe ADHD kicks in and she starts 3 tasks but makes no progress and by then it’s time to get the kids from school.

So that’s pretty much it. I feel stressed out because on top of a high pressure job, I have to cook and clean and do laundry because my wife struggles with these tasks. We communicate well and have open and honest communication about these things but nothing really changes.

In the beginning we had physical intimacy at least 5 to 6 times a week due to both of us having high libidos but in the past year, we only have sex once a month, if that. 

I have brought it up to him multiple times because sex is very important to me. It’s one of the main ways I feel loved and wanted. When I bring it up to him, he says the reason we don’t have sex much is because he has body image issues which as a plus size woman my entire life I completely understand how you see yourself affects every aspect of your life. 

It got to a point we had a huge argument about it, and I almost ended the engagement because I didn’t feel wanted or loved, but he promised he would work on it. It has been over a month and a half now and nothing has changed.

I know he still has a high sex drive because he masturbates at least three times a week. Because of this, I’ve asked him if it has something to do with me and he swears not that I’m just as beautiful as ever, but it is getting to a point where I’m tired of trying.  Every time I try to initiate, he laughed like I said a joke and changes the subject. The only time we are intimate is when he is drunk it’s getting to the point where it’s affecting how I see myself as well. When I try to make him aware that the only time he wants to have sex with me is when he’s drunk he says that’s not true and he’s sorry I think that.  When we do have sex, it just consists of me giving him head than riding him. Nothing else. We don’t even kiss.

I want to bring it up the intimacy issues again, but I’m not sure how to do that while still being sensitive over his body image issues. What are some ways that I can bring it up without him thinking I’m starting a fight just to start a fight??

 I don’t want to fight. I want to figure this out together. Other than the intimacy issues we’re great but it’s starting to take a toll as I have an extremely high libido and I’m feeling very unwanted in my relationship. ",1770330730.0,,False,False,True,N/A,,False,True,False,False,False,0.94,N/A

Me and my girlfriend have been together for around a year and half now and we've had a fairly decent relationship. We have a normal sex life but she's a bit on the chubby side and is conscious about it.

I have no problems with it at all, I actually find her really sexy but she cant seem to find it within her to appreciate her beauty. But something she said today really has got me some what spiralling.

I sent a reel about a sexy police outfit and she tells me no and says ""Sometimes I don't enjoy our intimacy at all""

I am not the kind of perosn and it really hurts me to think that she had to force herself to be intimate with me. It has me feeling shit and I dont know how to deal with this

Edit: its been 3 days now since this and we had an argument about this the next day and she told me that she used to fake it most of the time and she did it because I quote ""Because if you want to keep a man, you have to open your legs"".

We have been married for 3 years. He loves me deeply, he is great to me, he tolerates a lot of my bullshit. He’s honestly a perfect partner and has done nothing wrong.

I feel like a husk of a person. I do not know who I am because I have dedicated my entire life to our relationship. I have no friends, mostly of my own choosing because I don’t make friends easily. I have no hobbies. No desire to try anything new. I am extremely depressed and I feel like I simply do not have the capacity to be an adequate partner any longer.

I am increasingly fantasizing about leaving, moving into a studio apartment somewhere, living alone and just starting over. I just want to be by myself.

If I were to tell him I want to leave, he would be completely blindsided. It would devastate him. It would be cruel. I don’t know how I would even begin to have this kind of conversation with him. So much so, that I am considering just staying because he doesn’t deserve what this would put him through. I do not want to be selfish and harm a person who has been nothing but good to me.

Hi,

We had some trust issues previously ( found out she was on dating app when we were engaged). So there is some trust that needs to be rebuilt.

Recently my wife has started going out with her male colleagues for drinks at lunchtime every Friday at lunchtime for 2-3 hours. I only realised because one Friday I smelt alcohol on her breath and asked her and she mentioned it. 

It has now become a weekly occurrence - I am not particularly comfortable because a) it would be odd for her if I did the same with all female colleagues b) it seems rather overkill c) she didn’t even mention it I had to find out d) she never really says who she was with or really talks about it at all (like a normal convo for me when someone asks how your day was “oh I went for a few drinks with y and y and we talked about y and y). Not in a controlling way but that is what I always do because it’s fun.

Additionally, she got quite defensive when I asked her about post smelling her breath, because I was kind of confused why she didn’t even mention it at all and then even when mentioned wasn’t really willing to elaborate.

I am a little confused on how to move forward and what is considered controlling?

This was never brought up through years of dating or 2 years of marriage (although she literally went to a party and smoked when we dated) and I was literally in the military at the time and had nothing negative to say to her about it. Even throughout the dating phase I mentioned when I get out I was going to smoke again since I’ve never seen it being worse than drinking. But now I feel like I don’t even have the freedom to just be an adult around her. I did smoke once since I got out and she had some big overreaction to it and honestly that was more annoying to me than my several near death and close proximity to death experiences I’ve had throughout my life.

She had no opinion on it until I mentioned “when I get out I want to smoke every now and then” I get making sacrifices for the marriage and see no issue but I’ve always been a big advocate before, during and after service. Especially when I have several conditions that could benefit from marijuana use instead of taking 13 pills a day and feeling like shit still and no pain relief since I refuse opioids.

Honestly this could be venting but I just feel stuck. I want a chance at feeling normal, not super paranoid in public to the point I have to carry and there is a people or crowd limit or I’ll refuse to go.  I also don’t want to deal with back pain and about my whole right side being painful my whole wife. Overall I have stable income (the only income between us) and besides that I feel like besides cooking and cleaning I do literally everything else for the relationship since she can’t. I just want a break from life every now and then at least. I’m freaking miserable on a daily basis.

What do yall think of this situation? I’m not good at explaining so hopefully i didn’t go too far into feelings that it confused yall.

Edit: I want to add. Besides this, we have a happy(ish) marriage. I’m not the most fun personality since I’m always in pain or don’t want to be in public so I’m not constantly hyper vigilant. I honestly know marijuana works for my issues and just want to try having a normal life where I can go out and have fun, not overthink, not focus on my physical pain or any issues. I clearly don’t want a ruined marriage over this but it’s crazy to just ban that right?

About a year ago I decided I would clean the house for him while he was at work and ended up finding a singular dildo in a spare bathroom of his (in the tub). I freaked out and thought he was cheating on me but he told me it was his and he was ashamed of it. He was so mad that I had found it so I never brought it up again. 
I never fully believed the full extent of his story and unfortunately did some investigating around the house while he was working the next day. 

I later found a carry on size suitcase FULL of dildos and other sex toys. I also found 2 full stuffed trash bags of sex toys (mostly dildos and I think an actual mechanic fucking machine) in the trash when I went to put the cans out for trash day. 

I never told him I found these because of the sheer volume of toys. I didn’t want to embarrass him. 

However, today, a year after this incident, again I was putting things away and saw the suit case again. MUCH heavier than the last time (it is locked now). There was also a duffel bag of even more sex toys, some idek what they do sitting right on top of the suit case. (Both in a spare closet). 


The reason I need advice is because recently I feel he has not been as sexually into me and I’m worried he’s addicted to porn or whatever he’s doing with this immense collection of sex toys. 

I don’t know how to bring it up without making him feel judged or embarrassed. I’ve just been having a hard time feeling enough for him and trusting him knowing he’s hiding this huge thing from me and also taking such a long time to finish when we have intercourse. Is he maybe gay? Or just addicted? Or ashamed? We are also currently medium distance so he goes ghost when he’s home a lot and I can’t help but feel it’s for whatever the real story behind this is. 

Im very stuck on this dilemma.  And would love advice on if/how I should talk to him about it.",1759335336.0,,False,False,True,N/A,,False,True,False,False,False,0.81,N/A
143,2026/2/27,17: 8:59,1nqs5jx,relationshipadvice,Why has my [21F] husband [21M] suddenly changed after we had a baby?,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationshipadvice/comments/1nqs5jx/why_has_my_21f_husband_21m_suddenly_changed_after/,/r/relationshipadvice/comments/1nqs5jx/why_has_my_21f_husband_21m_suddenly_changed_after/,15,ASplashOfPepsi,14,"To preface, my husband and I have both had conversations about how we value traditional relationships and roles. He is supportive, but critical of my journey to being saved. He enjoys the values women have in the bible, and wants me to emulate those values. However, I have realised he does not emulate the traditional values a biblical man would, and I have been suffering in our marriage.

We just had a baby together. He was very excited and very supportive throughout my pregnancy. The second our baby was born it was like something shifted. He was stone cold. He was gone for an hour after the birth because he needed some time to himself since the birth was pretty rough for both of us. I was alone with my baby for an hour after the birth without his support. Little did I know this would only be the start.

He works full time so I watch the baby and take care of everything at night. The only thing he does is dress the baby after his daily baths and rarely changes a diaper on the weekends. At first I struggled with resentment because I felt I wasn't getting the support I needed. I was unable to do much without injuring myself the first few weeks of recovering. I changed all but a few diapers. I got ten hours of sleep total the first week home. I barely ate or drank anything. However, I still made sure my husband and baby were taking care of. I hated my husband in that moment. I had many breakdowns and spiralled.
I've never felt so sad and alone my entire life.

I made sure to voice my feelings to my husband. I felt overwhelmed by trying to balance the house chores, the baby, and trying to take care of him so he also knows he is loved. I felt like a failure.
He offers to help, however he will do the bare minimum by putting very little effort into house chores. If I ask him to cook me a dinner (we have to eat different things due to my sons allergies, and most days I don't cook for him he will eat a frozen meal) he will say he would rather watch the baby than make food because he doesn't know how. But then when he watches the baby he gets overwhelmed and angry.

He hates when the baby cries. It sets him off. He doesn't know what to do and panics. He gives him to me and leaves us two alone. He only wants to take care of baby if he is sleeping or able to soothe with a pacifier. But anything else he gets overwhelmed and freaked out. I have caught him a few times quietly telling our baby to ""shut up."" It absolutely hurts my heart and devastates me how he could talk to his son like that. I just wanted to cry hearing that. I have confronted him about this and he says he can't stand when he cries, and that he just wants a toddler to teach and spend time with.

He has disrespected me in so many ways I am beginning to regret marrying him. He was NOT like this when I was pregnant. Every day he will make a mess in the kitchen making a protein shake. There will be protein powder all over the kitchen counters.
There will be food spilled on the floor. Crumbs on the couch. He will leave used tissues all over the house. Dirty dishes all over the house. He doesn't wash his hands after using the bathroom and then touches our son. When I try to correct these behaviours I'm considered a nag and it turns into an argument. He knows I am struggling with keeping up. So why does he insist on adding on to the stress? I would not trust him alone with our son. But he uses my distrust as an excuse to not take care of him. He says I am turning him away from our son because I ""nag"" him. However, clean hands are a basic necessity when handling a baby!!! Just today i asked him to watch our son while I cleaned the house. I caught him swaddling our son with a thick blanket without any fan in a 70 degree room in our house!!!! I tried explaining to him it is too hot and babies are very prone to heat injuries and he said that this was the only way to calm him down and stop his crying. He still insisted on swaddling him so I couldn’t finish my cleaning after that.

I am so devastated and heart broken. I’m burnt out and depressed. I feel like I can’t keep up with everything. I understand I don’t make money currently, but I feel I still work hard. And taking care of a newborn is no joke!! My baby is my pride and joy and I love being a mother, but I am suffering being a wife. 

I can’t get over how well he treated me while pregnant.
I am drowning and can use any encouragement / advice. 


So sorry for your loss any grammatical errors. I’m sure there are plenty. Im running on very little sleep while I feed baby for the night!",1758861307.0,,False,False,True,N/A,,False,False,False,False,False,0.78,N/A

But in the last 4 years, I’ve been looking for something more meaningful. I’ve had 2 relationships that didn’t work out and after reflecting, I realized I was pretty naive about how to make a long-term relationship succeed. I had my share of faults in both, even though neither of them were right for me.

About 3 months ago, I started dating this amazing woman. She makes me feel like a teenager again. We laugh, joke, and just click. I genuinely feel like she’s the one.

The problem: she thinks she’s “punching” (dating out of her league). We’ve talked about it before and I thought it was resolved… until last weekend.

We went on a little trip and stopped at this pub by a river for lunch. She went to get us drinks, and apparently some older guy told her she was punching. She really took it to heart. I tried to tell her that if he actually knew her, he’d realize it’s me who’s punching. But she’s still clearly affected by it.

I want her to feel secure, but I’m struggling to find the right way to help her see herself the way I see her. I do not want to come across as overbearing or making comparisons to my past. I've told her about my past and it makes her uncomfortable that I slept around so much.

I have written the following and want to read it to her: 

I want to try and explain to you how I feel about you. The best metaphor I could come up with is, imagine you had a job as a professional food taster, tasting all of these dishes which are organised nicely and and on the surface are pretty impressive but don't invoke any kind of deep emotion. While some dishes are slightly better than others, really they're all the same, just a bit of sustainance that holds you over until the next time you get hungry. But then you find your family's old cook book. You follow a recipe to the letter and on your first bite, all of the emotions, built from your childhood and experiences while you were first in wonder and awe of the world, excited to explore it's depth and wonder, come flooding into your mind, body and soul. A dish that you could eat for breakfast lunch and dinner for the rest of time and it never lose it's beauty and importance to you. That's you. You are the dish that feels like home, the dish that I don't need to explain to anyone and that makes me excited for the life ahead of me.",1754767811.0,,False,False,True,N/A,,False,False,False,False,False,1.0,N/A

bit of a longer one as there is a lot to cover, but i (23F) am feeling really lost in regards to my 4.5 year relationship with my boyfriend (25M) and essentially am too scared to leave.
For context: my boyfriend studies full-time, barely works (maybe 1 shift a week in retail) and will mostly study at the uni for 12 hours a day. I work 5 shifts per week, mostly 10 hour shifts as an RN and am generally exhausted all the time.
He never has time for me: doesn't communicate, doesn't message me good morning or goodnight, and doesn't really check how my day went. I find that I ALWAYS have to call him (this is usually once a day after my shift). He never makes an effort to plan dates, even cheap or free ones. He almost never buys me flowers (even though I express how much I love them) and generally doesn't make me feel very loved.
I express to him constantly that i want more communication from him. Just one message per day telling me he loves me, and that communicate is a big thing for me. Whilst he acknowledges it, he never changes. During his exam period, I don't hear from him for days sometimes.
I live out of home and he lives at home still, which is not really an issue for me, however I do feel like after 4.5 years, there would be some focus on wanting to move out together as a couple. Whenever he comes to stay at my house, he is not the most tidy person either. If I leave for work early, I will come home after a 10 hour shift with my bed a mess, and his wet towel from the shower on my bed.
I honestly just feel as though we're in very different stages of life. He's going to be studying for another 2 years and won't be ready to move out until he's finished uni. He doesn't have money because he doesn't work, and I can't financially support him. I feel a disconnect because I want to go on dates every now and again, and do fun stuff, but he never does.
I guess I just feel like the relationship has reached an end? I just feel really sad because I have essentially spent 4.5 years with him and still love him so much- it's just not working. I don't know if i should leave, or how I should leave, or even if i'm strong enough to? I guess I just really need some advice.

Me and my partner have been together for 2 and a half years, we are both super emotionally vulnerable with eachother, never once had an argument and have what I would consider a very healthy relationship and bond. 

Recently our sex life feels like it has completely died. We both know the reason why, we both have expressed to eachother for months now how unattractive we both feel. 

We have had honest discussions about this to eachother, I have assured my attraction to him vice versa, but anyone who is going through the same feelings about themselves knows it doesn't matter how much someone tells you you're beautiful or they love you or are attracted to you, if YOU don't feel that way, nothing will they say will help. 

We haven't been physical in 4 months now. I'm super grateful that I have a partner that respects me and doesn't push for intimacy when I am not feeling confident and my partner has expressed the same. But now I have reached a point where I'm worried and feeling guilty.

We have both been in this slump and been consumed by our insecurities. We have both gained happy relationship weight, my skin has broken our badly etc. These have all taking a toll on the both of us and has completely killed our self confidence. Which has then turned into killing our sex life. 

Cuddling, kissing etc are all still happening! But when it comes to sex, we both cannot get over our unattractive we feel. 

Although we have talked about it honestly I'm starting to get worried about the affect it is having in our relationship. 

Maybe I am just an overthinker, but I'm worried maybe I am adding fuel to the fire by making him feel rejected? And to myself honestly, it's like a horrible catch 22 where I don't want sex because I feel ugly, then I feel ugly because I don't feel desired. 

What can we do without potentially making eachother feel forced / fuelling our insecurities further? 

We are both working on losing weight and what not, but this feeling of ""ugliness"" is not an easy fix, not for me atleast. I know getting in shape isn't going to magically fix how I feel about myself quickly. 

So how can we revive our sex life? 

Do we bite the bullet and have to let ourselves be uncomfortable? 

I just don't want it to make how we feel even worse but at the same time I don't want my partner to feel rejected because we aren't having sex either! ",1749156162.0,,False,False,True,N/A,,False,True,False,False,False,0.93,N/A

A little over a month ago my wife told me about this guy at work who makes her really nervous because he’s attractive and has an f-boy reputation. This wasn’t really shocking, attractive men have always made her nervous. Then one day she suddenly started talking to him more. It started off as them just getting along and learning they had a lot of common interests and she eventually got his Snapchat from another coworker. I’ve never had anything against my wife being able to have guy friends and I wasn’t against this one at first, but within a week of this new friendship my wife confided in me that she felt she needed to “have more experiences” her and I married very young and she felt she missed out on discovering herself and now was asking me if I would consider letting her explore. This 100% just meant having sex with another guy and I ended up finding out she specifically meant this new guy friend from work. This wasn’t the start of my suspicions and honestly some of our current problems. Another week goes by and my wife tells me she is going out with her girl friends (they do this regularly). Me and my wife use Life 360. An app that more or less lets you see someone’s location at all times. I spent the night periodically checking where she was, which isn’t new and something she always knew I did when she went out super late. It’s just so I know where she is in case of an emergency. Late in the night I saw she had been at a house for a little over an hour and just assumed she was at her girl friends house like she told me she would be. Later when she got home I asked her how her night went and she told me all they did was drive around and occasionally stop for food or to listen to music. I immediately had a worried look that she asked me about and I said it was nothing and we went to bed. Later I woke up, about 4am and couldn’t stop thinking about it so I decided to get up and look through her phone. I know this crossed a major line and I was sorry about it the moment I decided but I was desperately hoping all my suspicions were wrong. The messages I found between her and her new guy bestie made me so lightheaded and hurt. They were texting earlier that day, talking about how much they wanted to kiss and have sex and he even detailed a couple things he wanted to do to her and she was into all of it. And then I saw their messages about her girl friends dropping her off at his house that night linked with the address I saw her at on Life 360. I immediately woke up my wife and confronted her about it. Ever since then and including that early morning. She has been adamant that she was just “harmlessly flirting” and what she did was not cheating. I have no idea what I should be thinking anymore. I don’t want to divorce her to be honest, but she has persisted that she and him stay friends and there is nothing happening between them. She often goes and hangs out with him to watch movies, as a matter of fact she is with him right now as I make this post. Her and I are at a complete disagreement regarding how we should fix our problem. She thinks I should just trust her because she’s says she’s not lying. And I think she needs to completely drop him even as a friend. But I have not made that request because I am trying to believe her and I don’t want to sound manipulative or controlling. I actually just don’t know what to do. I feel like she genuinely just doesn’t really want to be with me anymore but doesn’t want any to be the one to initiate a divorce.

151,2026/2/27,17: 8:59,1kbm7qb,relationshipadvice,I [27M] need advice on how to tell my partner [29F] that she should put more effort into how she presents herself to people.,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationshipadvice/comments/1kbm7qb/i_27m_need_advice_on_how_to_tell_my_partner_29f/,/r/relationshipadvice/comments/1kbm7qb/i_27m_need_advice_on_how_to_tell_my_partner_29f/,13,WillingGift5190,31,"I [27M] recognize that in the title of this I sound like an a**hole who is telling my partner [28F] what to wear but please show me some grace. 

I love and adore my girlfriend. She is the most lovely, kind, fun, supporting, and reliable partner I have ever had. She is gorgeous and I am grateful to be with her. 

Due to controlling circumstances of her upbringing my partner has a, “I don’t care how people see me” attitude when it comes to meeting people and her appearance. I am not against this as I find it brings great comfort when you let go of your feelings on other peoples opinions and have actively encouraged her to not put emotional stock in what other people’s opinions MIGHT be.

However the issue: my girlfriend’s appearance often matches her “I don’t care attitude.” She dresses for comfort usually in a tank top and leggings or sweatpants and often these really old stained slippers instead of shoes. She doesn’t wear deodorant and refuses to brush her hair but instead puts oils in it. When we go out to dinner or meeting family and friends for special occasions she often steps up the outfits from comfort to something very casual. Most of the time I am not bothered as I really do accept my partner, though occasionally I have been put off by a choice for a special occasion. 

Let me be clear I myself am not bothered by these things. I love my girlfriend, I think she’s beautiful, I have no sense of smell so BO doesn’t bother me, and I’m too much of a boy to really notice the hair. I think she’s f***ing adorable. 
I myself am a person who likes to feel presentable. I was raised by spiritual hippies but in my career and upbringing while it was never a harsh thing it was always pointed out to my siblings and I the importance of presenting ourselves to the world in a way we’d like to be seen. Your appearance is how the world will see you. I’ll wear comfort cloths for errands but I dress up well when I have a social gatherings, professional engagements, or special events. Outfits are costumes that you wear as needed.
I’m not a suit and tie person per se but I do like to be presentable and show really good manners and etiquette. 

The reason that this has become something that I need advice on is that people outside of our relationship have been bringing this up to me privately. 
They have described her appearances as “careless”, “middle school girl”, and on the harshest note “homeless.” 
Women have told me that she needs to brush her hair and stop using the oils because it makes her hair look unwashed.
Someone said they were “surprised we were together” as she is beautiful but careless in her appearance where I am not. 
All of these people point out how naturally beautiful she is but express concern with the presentation.
It was relayed to me through someone who works with her that apparently there have been nights where her coworkers “couldn’t stand next to her” because the BO was so bad. 
To be clear my partner does shower often and has a regular routine where she cares for her hygiene. And as her partner I do defend her in those private conversations. 
On top of this my girlfriend is kind but has pretty poor etiquette when meeting people but this is often due to social anxiety. She often does not respond or engage when people greet her and I’ve seen her ignore many handshakes or simply not respond when people initiate contact with her. Occasionally all she will say is “Hi.” She says that she simply doesn’t care about that stuff and that she’s still being nice to them. I know that she prefers to wait before opening up to people, but it sometimes comes off as rude to others even if I know it’s not.

My partner has been struggling to make friends and connections in our city. Many people cancel on her or just don’t show up. 
She is the most kind, loving, and accepting person but I am concerned and have a gut feeling that her, “I don’t care, I don’t want to be noticed attitude” may be overplayed in how she presents herself and is turning people off to the idea of connecting with her. 

I have tried to bring this up in gentle and subtle opportunities and even family members of mine have pointed it out directly to her. I try to phrase it as a positive and not a negative. I encourage her to wear the outfits that really do highlight her natural beauty “Honey you look amazing!” I’ve occasionally encouraged her to wear deodorant after a night of wine where even I can smell it. And told her that in the climate we live in she needs to brush her hair (total bullshit but I’m a dumb boy trying to be gentle). Every time she buckles down harder saying, “I don’t want to feel like my choice of appearance is being taken away,” which I do understand. She also said, “I WILL NOT SUBMIT TO THE PATRIARCHY” which we both laughed at. But she told me that bringing it up was hurting her confidence and that she loves herself as she is. 
I love my partner so much and recognize that many of these opinions and habits are how she has decided to be in opposition to conformity due to past wounds she has experienced. We have had issues in the past due to her insecurity of thinking she’s not good enough or pretty enough which I have done all I can to provide reassurance and validation. 

I recognize this is a lot and I appreciate you reading to the end. Has anyone been in a situation like this with their partner or someone close to them? Are there any women who can share insight on how I should approach this? Thank you all for your time. Best wishes in all you do 🙏🏻

He’s great and we’ve been talking about getting engaged soon, but we keep having the same argument about him not being able to do gross chores. We used to take turns doing the cat litter, but every time he would do it, he would be gagging and retching the whole time, and then would be dry heaving in the bathroom after. We eventually agreed that he would take up some other chores and I would exclusively do the cat litter, which has worked out so far. 

Except that I had to go out of town for a bit and I told him that he would have to take care of it while I was gone, and he just didn’t do it and the cat started going outside of the litter box because it was dirty. Also he makes me pick it up whenever the cat throws up or makes any other kind of gross mess because it makes him gag. He didn’t grow up with pets or having to do gross chores, so I’ve always thought that he would get used to it or desensitized to stuff like this over time, but he hasn’t. I truly can’t tell if he’s just being dramatic or might have some kind of issue that makes gross stuff like that worse to him? 

I really love him, and he’s really a great partner in every other aspect, but I’m having doubts about getting engaged or other long term commitments like having kids someday. If he can’t handle a cat hairball, what happens if I get sick and need his help to clean up, what happens if we have kids and he can’t handle diapers or other gross stuff kids do? Kids can objectively be disgusting at times, but we both want them someday. I’m just starting to see a future where I’m stuck changing every diaper or cleaning up puke all by myself. 

Is there a way to help desensitize him to gross stuff? Is there maybe a medical reason that could be making him so sensitive to the smell or sight of gross stuff? Any advice would be appreciated, thank you

Update: I had a long conversation with him and laid out my concerns, and he’s agreed to try a kind of exposure therapy by doing the litter and other things to try and help him get used to it. Thanks to the person who suggested to wear a mask while he does it, that’ll be a good way to ease him into it! But I’ve made it clear that we’re not going to get engaged or married unless he can grow up and deal with stuff like this. Thanks for all the advice!

Lately he has started complaining more and I am honestly tired of hearing about it. I give him advice, love, affection…. Everything I can think of and he is still never truly happy. He thinks he is failing our son (4 years old) and believes he is not where he is supposed to be in his life for his age.

I feel like he’s not really trying hard enough to want better the way he claims. He is currently in school and works part time. He gets paid to go to school and will be debt free when he graduates.

Upstairs has 4 bedrooms, ours having a bathroom as well. Downstairs is a large living room/dining room area, kitchen, laundry room, bathroom. The dynamic with kids/roommates has been working out pretty well I feel like. I have my toddler every weekend and am working on getting him here full time. His 1st grader is here about every other weekend. We have one roommate who stays on the couch in the living room, and 2 others who share a bedroom. The boys share the 3rd bedroom, and the 4th is a work room for projects. 

Where the problem lies, is my boyfriend pretty much exclusively only hangs out in our bedroom upstairs. We have a projector mounted on our wall, so its like having a massive tv in there. If I want to spend time with him, all he ever wants to do is chill on the bed and put on a show. His daily routine is basically go downstairs, make himself food, go upstairs and eat.

He claims that he doesn't like being in the living room, due to it being ""messy"" all the time. (I'm the only one that cleans and I keep it at a level that I think is okay, not spotless, but lived in). Also, my roommate that stays in the living room goes to work, so it can't even be said that he doesn't want to be down here because of him.

Mind you, my kid has a toy chest in here, so the living room/dining room area gets scattered with toys when he is here. I will go around and pick them up, only for him to pull them back out within 30 minutes. Occasionally he will come down and play with my son while I'm busy doing dishes or something, but dissappears again after.

He claims that it's ""not like he's avoiding me, I know where he is and I can always go by him upstairs"", which is technically true, but I've explained to him that just sitting in a dark room staring at a screen just reminds me of the years I spent in deep depression. I still do it, but he knows that it's not really what I like to do.

Last night I got excited because he agreed to come downstairs and hang out with me. I was thinking we would have a game night or something and actually have fun together. Apparently I made the mistake of ""only saying I wanted to play jenga"" so after 2 rounds of jenga (he won both times) I started putting it away and tried suggesting a different game. He decided to just say ""I'm going upstairs"" and walked away. I was crushed. 

I stayed downstairs and ended up texting him about how sad, hurt, and rejected I felt after he ditched me like that. The conversation really didn't go anywhere good, so I had to change subjects to avoid it being a fight.

Idk if there's anything I can do. I feel like even if I cleaned the house to the point of being immaculate, he would still find an excuse to avoid being down here. Just before typing this I called him out on not wanting anything to do with me and the kid I thought he considered to be ""his son"" because with the way hes been acting lately, it doesn't really seem like he wants to spend time with him. My kid doesn't want to just sit on a bed in the dark all day either.

 He is a very insecure person. Yesterday, he, his friend and I were in a discord call. Everyone doing their own thing. I was playing league. I finished a game and a person I was playing with invited me to play again. And I accepted. We played 3 games. Our only conversation (in chat ) was ""ready?"" ""Yep"" ""Again?"" ""Yep"".

When we spoke, he told me that he was angry and disappointed that I was playing with someone else. I understand his feelings, but it also seems stupid to me since we were simply in a duo in ranked. I told him that it was nothing, but he stills mad at me. Even in call, he doesn't actually talks to me. We texted a bit later:
Him: ""I know you said youre sorry and whatever but, if l am completely honest I think you knew how it would make me feel and that's why you were so quiet about it and didn't say anything at all, yet still did it, and i know you said you changed your password a few days ago but idk man, that just seems so odd, why now suddenly after years of that password, too many things genuinely bothered and upset me about it all today.""
Me: ""l understand your point. But honestly, you are looking so deep into something so stupid. I already apologized. 1. Did I go quiet? No. Nobody was fucking talking. 2. Did I change my password? Yes. Some days ago to match other passwords. |'m not going to apologize for changing my passport. I did not know you log in into my league? And, by the way, ""your password was working before"" why you even getting into my league? You see, that's why I mean. Is like you are looking for something, waiting for me to do any mistake.""

As said, I apologized. But I honestly work so hard to get over his trust issues (no, they are not even because of me.

 Even if I understand his point, I don't see why make such a big fight and not even taik to me to fix things, or try to ""fix things"" but still low-key ignoring me and being cold. I just want a different perspective 🤚🏻

163,2026/2/27,17: 8:59,1nwncqc,relationshipadvice,I [31F] am regretting my marriage with my husband [50M] but I'm not sure about leaving.,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationshipadvice/comments/1nwncqc/i_31f_am_regretting_my_marriage_with_my_husband/,/r/relationshipadvice/comments/1nwncqc/i_31f_am_regretting_my_marriage_with_my_husband/,10,Chocolate_at_night,26,"I know that the red flags start in the title with our age gap. I \[31F\] have been with my husband \[50M\] for 8 years, married for 6. There's so much important context and so many nuances to my situation, but I'll try to keep it short. I want to start by saying that he's a great man. He's never been violent, either verbally or physically, never cheated on me, it's always loving and attentive with me, my dog, my family, he cares for my career and always pushes me to be better, take risks and try new things. He does have certain attitudes that have created problems in our past, but he has shown the will to work on those and has made progress. For all these reasons and many more is why I'm having such a difficult time with my feelings.

I've been carrying this feeling for the past two years in which I've been noticing that I've been building some resentment towards him. For example, in the 6 years we've been married and living together, he has never ever cleaned our home. He does dishes, and maybe the ocasional load of laundry. But mostly the whole laundry, the dusting, organizing, vacuuming and moping have always fallen on me. There's been times when I tell him that I don't think this is fair, and his response has always been to offer to clean the bathroom. The last time I said ""Ok, from now on you in charge of cleaning the bathroom,"" however, I decided that I'm not going to tell him when or how to do it. So I waited and waited, but he never cleaned it, even though it got noticeably dirty, so I kept on doing it myself. This is only the smallest of my grievances.

My biggest resentment however started two years ago, after I finished a post-graduate degree that enabled me to make more money on my career, so for the past 2 years I've been the main earner in our marriage. This has come with very long work hours and adding to that, I've been working towards learning a new language, because we both want to move to a different country and this language is essential to achieve this goal. There was a time when I'd be working 14 hours on top of taking a 3 hour language class everyday. He, on the other hand, has been working towards completing his PhD for the past 6 years (he should have finished a year ago, but hasn't been able to) which I know is no easy task at all. He does all his PhD work from home, and when I started working long hours he started doing all the cooking for us, without complaining (again, he's a very caring man), but the rest of the house work kept falling on me, plus the mental load of any other tasks like planing our trips, planing every time we had to move, and the care of our elderly dog, among others. There is more resentment related to this situation that I won't get into, like him telling me he has no time left for anything other than his PhD, but then spending hours of unpaid work for other people. So in short, I have taken multiple projects and hours of overtime to bring more money to our home, while also doing most of the housework and taking the steps to immigrate to the country we're aiming to, while he just concentrates on his thesis and does unpaid projects for friends.

In addition to this, I recently came to terms with the fact that he's really bad and irresponsible with finances. And I feel so stupid because there were neon red signs from the start. A few weeks before our wedding he confessed to me that he had a massive credit card debt, but he promised he'll be able to pay it in 3 years. To his credit, he handled it by himself and never asked me for anything related to paying off his debt. However, I can't help but think that we could have been more comfortable and would've struggle less with money if it weren't for that. He was able to pay off his initial debt about a year ago, but then a few weeks ago he confessed that again he has accumulated more credit card debt during this past year. To be clear, for the past year I've been paying for the biggest expenses: rent, utilities, health insurance, and any expensive activities. I also paid for his last semester's tuition. He pays for groceries and restaurants and bars when we go out. I know there's nothing shady happening like gambling or drugs, I feel like he just doesn't think twice about spending money he doesn't have and making big purchases (like buying me a ps5, or buying himself expensive equipment, or both of us going to a fancy spa). And even after all this, he's trying to convince me to take a big trip, which would take a lot of money from the savings I'm trying to keep and invest. I told him no, but then he goes and talks as if the trip is happening anyways. He keeps saying that money comes and goes and we only live once. I'm not kidding when I say that this situation and his insistence has me walking around feeling a strong and constant pressure on my chest.

My biggest fear and problem today is that I feel that he doesn't want to work towards the future we said we both want. I feel that I've grown and matured while he hasn't. He's 50 years old and has no property, no assets, no savings, and I have the feeling that he doesn't care for any of those things, even though I've told him how much I need safety and security in my life to be happy. For the past years I've been longing for a baby, but I just haven't felt secure enough in our finances and living situation to be able to do it, which makes me incredibly sad and angry because he's 18 years older than me, so I don't think it's crazy to expect from him a certain level of stability. Today, I'm the one with the savings, the one thinking about buying a home, making more money, starting a family. On top of that, I'm not sure that he wants the same things as me, even though he says he does. For example, every time I mention wanting a baby, he responds by saying things like ""but we already have our dog"" and ""our dog is our baby,"" or when I mention wanting a house he says things along the lines of ""there's really no reason for us to own property."" When I told him I feel like he doesn't want to have a baby with me he told me that, while he never wanted kids, it would be stupid of him not to want to have kids with me. This answer doesn't really give me a lot of assurance. And even though he says he wants to, he's been actively avoiding getting me pregnant.

There are so many other things that I haven't mention that would make this post twice its size. The reason I've been building this resentment without talking to him is because I know how he's going to react. At any small problem he immediately turns to divorce. I know that the first advice will be to ""have a sincere conversation with him."" And well, I'm coming to reddit after having a sincere conversation with him, and exactly what I thought would happen, happened. I told him that I feel disappointed in him (in relation to a more tamed situation than what I've described in this post). His reaction was to tell me that he's sorry for being the way he is, and immediately followed by saying that maybe he shouldn't come back home (he's on a trip) and ask me if I think we should get a divorce. I know this is a manipulation tactic. He always turns himself into the victim and makes me feel bad for how bad I'm making him feel. Right now we are barely talking, and he tends to just wait for me to get over it. I'm at a point where I know we could work through this with couple's counseling and therapy, the problem is that I don't feel I have the energy or motivation to, first, convince him to do it, and then to put in the work needed. I'm drained, unhappy, numb and depressed. Not only I'm unmotivated in relation with my marriage but towards my life in general.

He says he loves me more than anything in his life and to please not divorce him, but then his first and only solution to our problems is divorce.

Most days I'm happy with him and his company and the love he gives me. I love him too, but I'm scared about the future and feel that I need to be smart about it now that I'm getting older and want to start a family soon. I would love to hear any other perspectives and any advice on, whether if and how to leave, or how to find the will to continue with this life and this marriage.

Thank you for reading me.

We usually have a very loving relationship. We talk every day. He’s the kind of person who, when he’s stressed, tends to shut down, but normally he just takes the night and then the next day we go back to talking as usual.

Yesterday was different.

We had planned to spend Saturday together. It had been raining the night before, and we were both saying how much we wanted to cuddle up and spend the day together. I work from home, and I wanted to go out for lunch first before heading back, so when he picked me up, I suggested a restaurant by the sea. He said no because too many of his coworkers go there. I suggested another one, and he said, “Can we go somewhere cheaper?”

That surprised me, because it’s the first time he’s said something like that, but I know he’s been having a lot of expenses lately. He usually pays for everything, so I offered to invite him this time. He got upset and said, “No, I’ll pay.” I insisted, “Really, it’s fine, I’d love to treat you this time.” He snapped and told me not to insist.

We went anyway, but the atmosphere was tense. He was ignoring me, and I ended up crying in the bathroom (I’ve been very sensitive because of hormonal treatment). Later he softened, we had a beer, and things seemed a bit better.

On the way back, we passed the boardwalk by the ocean. I love the sea, so I said just walking there and having a couple of beers at the little stands makes me happy. He asked if I wanted to stop, and I said yes. But he seemed tired, so I said, “Are you sure? We can just go home.” He agreed to go home.

As he was turning to head toward the boardwalk, he asked me if he could take a turn there. I said yes, I thought it was allowed. But apparently it wasn’t, because two policemen stopped us. He tried to avoid it, and in the process, he hit the car badly—the whole rear door was damaged. He didn’t get a ticket because he’s in the military, but he was extremely upset.

We went back to my place so he could calm down. I thought things would settle, but instead, he came upstairs really agitated. He noticed the door on his side couldn’t close and said, “I’m leaving.” I tried to stop him, suggesting he park my car instead or sit down a bit before leaving, but he just repeated, “I’m leaving, I’m leaving,” looking straight into my eyes, almost furious. And then he left.

I sent him a voice message saying I was sorry, that I only wanted to spend a nice day with him, and that I felt bad about what happened with his car. I even told him I had vacuumed the apartment and washed his pajamas in the morning so everything would be nice for him.

His only reply was: “Hi, I’m home.”

Since then, nothing. That was 6pm yesterday. It’s now 1:30pm the next day. I called him last night, this morning, and texted “good morning.” No answer. He had brought me some Christmas lights the day before, so I texted him “thanks for the lights.” Still nothing.

We have never gone a full day without talking, and I don’t know what to do. I feel so hurt and confused. If he loves me, why would he want to stay away from me like this? And if it wasn’t my fault, why does it feel like he’s punishing me? How can I manage this.

He told me he had never been unfaithful to any of the women he was with, but he was unfaithful to them all.  He told me was totally loyal and thought only about me; yet he just admitted to me that he looks at pictures of other women when he masturbates and that it's normal, all men do it, but it's okay because he's with me. Like seriously, does he think I should feel honored. I am an intelligent, attractive and accomplished woman, who by the way was supporting him while he was not working, and while I was at work he lay in our bed jerking off to other women.  I feel this is the highest level of disrespect and that he is a low class man with even lower standards.  If you saw some of the woman he was viewing....enough to make most men shrivel up.  P.S.  before I met him I discovered he was on hook up sites, paying for naked pictures of women, sent an email to a porn site asking if they could use him, had a rub and tug places phone number in his contacts under the name ""Milk""  He had excuses for these saying the woman that he was with treated him badly and that she was an alcoholic, etc.  I don't believe that anymore, I think he probably drove her to drink with his behavior as he tries to make you think you are crazy when dating sites, porn sites, and the likes are in his Google history.

My wife shared the group's reactions with me and I was surprised by how accepting the group was, making jokes about it and treating it like a fun adventure. It didn't seem like anyone considered the situation from the perspective of Holly's husband. The culture of the group seemed fine with the situation, like they didn't mind that one of them was sleeping around without their spouse's knowledge. Holly doesn't have an open marriage, and she isn't telling the husband what happened.

After my wife was done sharing, I pointed out that Holly was, in fact, cheating and it was strange that no one was calling it like it is. My wife completely looked away when I said this, as if she were embarrassed that this hadn't crossed her mind, or like she was guilty of siding with a cheater. She then said Holly and her husband haven't had sex in years, and that Holly probably only did it b/c she was caught up in the thrill of travel, and that she wouldn't have made those same decisions at home. I told her it sounded like she was trying to justify Holly's actions. She rejected that, agreed that Holly was making bad choices, and said she was only trying to show how it could have happened. She also said Holly would probably change her mind on divorce once she got back to her normal routine; I told her that only makes the cheating even worse.

My wife's reaction to her friend is disturbing b/c my wife also travels frequently for work. If it makes sense to her that people can get carried away and behave differently while traveling, then what's to stop that from happening to her? The whole situation seemed to almost normalize the idea that you get a cheat-pass if your marriage has issues and you are away from home, then you can just change your mind without any consequence. 

My wife hasn't done anything to betray my trust, but it's the little things that add up. Like all in the past year: 

* My son \[15m\] said he had to wait in the car while she was ""flirting"" with a stranger, but she shut that down as innocent and then my son wouldn't elaborate. 
* She often has dinner one-on-one with male friends, and sometimes seems to avoid telling me about it beforehand, but then doesn't try to hide anything if I find out about it afterward. 
* She said she doesn't want to travel to a certain place where the social drinking is strong b/c last time she was there she got black-out drunk to the point that she lost consciousness. This by itself isn't an issue b/c she recognizes her vulnerability and plans to avoid it, but again, it adds up. 
* She's looking for an apartment in another city that she frequently travels to so she doesn't always have to stay in a hotel. This makes sense from a practical perspective, and affordability is not an issue, but a lot of couples wouldn't consider living in separate cities. 

None of this is cause for concern on its own, but taken as a whole, along with her reaction to her friend cheating, it gets me thinking. I don't believe she would willfully betray me, but don't most cheating stories begin that way?  And I do think she has a tendency to deceive herself, I could see her liking the attention and slipping into an emotional affair without even admitting it to herself. 

TL;DR; My wife seemed to condone her friend's infidelity, which makes some of her other behavior more alarming. Maybe there are actual red flags here, or maybe I'm overreacting, I'm open to either possibility. ",1756945368.0,,False,False,True,N/A,,False,False,False,False,False,0.79,N/A

But our intimate relationship has completely fallen apart over the past two years.

When we first started dating, our sex drives were very compatible, sometimes she even wanted it more than I did. It didn’t always have to be intercourse either, foreplay and physical closeness were enough. At some point, though, things shifted. She just stopped wanting intimacy, and the more I tried to initiate, the less interested she seemed.

We don’t have kids. She has seen specialists, tried medication, and we’ve gone to two different therapists, but nothing has changed. Every time I initiate now, I get turned down. She’ll say she doesn’t want to make out, doesn’t want to be touched, or that her head or back hurts and she’s too tired.

The last straw for me was on my birthday. She seemed into it at first, we started doing things, but then I realized she was checking her email while we were in the middle of it. That completely killed it for me.

At this point, I’ve resorted to just taking care of myself, but she’s against me watching porn. She says it’s her body and she’s working on “fixing it,” but it’s been over two years now. What frustrates me more is that she’ll say she’s too tired or in pain when I try to initiate, yet still has the energy to go out drinking with friends or to concerts with mosh pits. I’ve also noticed she’s more open to intimacy after a couple of glasses of wine, but I don’t drink much myself.

I feel stuck and depressed. I love her and don’t want to leave, but I also feel like our sex life is dead. At this point, I don’t even feel like trying anymore.",1756434126.0,,False,False,True,N/A,,False,False,False,False,False,1.0,N/A

We were close friends for three years before things turned romantic. He lives in LA to co-parent his teenage son; I live in San Diego and work as an Artist/Illustrator in  Native American community.

In 2023, I briefly dated someone who lied about being Native, stole money, cheated, and ultimately assaulted me. I got a temporary restraining order, but the courts denied a permanent one. For a while he backed off, but lately I’ve started receiving death threats and harassing messages from burner numbers, and I strongly believe it’s him.

I’ve gone to the police, but they won’t take action without proof of identity. So I’ve been working with digital investigators to trace the source before I can press charges. I didn’t want to tell my current partner because things have been rocky, but I ended up telling him.

His response crushed me. He said he doesn’t want to see or speak to me until I “handle it,” and he hasn’t checked in or asked how I’m doing. I feel abandoned and deeply hurt. I understand he has his own safety and family to think about, but I’m the one being targeted, and I didn’t choose any of this.

This is my first post and I am seeking some outside help. Some background information I am 23 female and I have been with my 27 male boyfriend who we’ll call Dan for almost 2 years now. 
I have been struggling with my weight since covid where I gained around 40 pounds. I was depressed, alone, and I honestly just let myself go/stopped caring. This recent year I had a really honest look at myself and I knew something had to change. I’ve started eating healthier, going to the gym, I joined 2 casual sports teams and in general have been trying to be more active. 

I can admit that since being home since university I have been fluctuating in weight. I loose it and gain it and it’s just a cycle. 

Dan called me last night and said he’s been going to therapy and has discovered that he tends to hide his anger/doesn’t tell me things that annoy him because he doesn’t want to fight or upset me but that he knows it’s not conducive to a healthy relationship so he’s been working on it. 

I asked him if there was anything specific that he can think of where he’s hidden his anger/resentment towards me and he revealed that he’s resentful about the way I look. In his opinion I said I wanted to loose weight but I “haven’t done enough” and as a result for the past 6 months he has resented me. 

He said he’s concerned for my health and he’s worried it’s a moral difference between us because “he cares about his appearance and I don’t” 

The hypocritical thing is tho is he gets fast food 2-3 times a week, he usually gets a beer after class (3-4 time a week), and gets Starbucks daily. 

A few months ago I told him that something I struggle with is his late night snacking. He doesn’t just snack he SNACKS. I’m talking a bag of chips, Oreos, chocolate, candies, etc., and he always offers me some. In my mind that’s like waving drugs in an addicts face and I know I can also be mentally strong and turn it down but regardless it’s something he said he would stop and hasn’t. 

Additionally he loves going out to eat. He goes out probably 3-4 times a month either with me or just with friends. This is something else I asked if we could stop and limit it to once a month which he still hasn’t done either. 

I’m just absolutely crushed. I confided in him that my mom has always said negative things about my weight even when I was at my thinnest and weight is something I’ve always struggled with. I’ve never been a stick thin girl even as a child. My dad would say I was “big boned” but this is to say that it’s been a consistent issue/trauma/insecurity of mine which he was aware of. 

My question is how can I ever feel beautiful again in his eyes? How can he claim to still be attracted to me yet for the past 6 months he’s resented the way I look? I should also mention I am definitely plus sized but I’m not 300-400 pounds. 

I want to know that if this happened to you could you move on? Could you ever believe you are beautiful to him? I truly don’t know what to do. I love him and I thought we were happy, we’ve talked about marriage, moving in together and spending the rest of our lives together. I just need some advice on how to move forward and I apologize for the long post! ",1749748448.0,,False,False,True,N/A,,False,False,False,False,False,0.87,N/A

I find myself in a really bad situation, and I need some advice on how I should proceed. I'll keep it short—I don't want to bore anyone to death.

Last month, I was at my boyfriend’s apartment (we’ve been together for two years), just hanging out. He called me over to show me something on his computer, on one of his monitors. As I was about to leave, my eyes wandered to the other monitor, and that’s when I saw it.

He had his Downloads folder open while he was working on something, and one picture immediately caught my eye. It was small, but I could tell what it was: a woman—not fully naked, but posing seductively, with a very deep cleavage (you could see her whole breasts) and short shorts, with her hands between her legs. I froze. I didn’t know what to think.

I asked him what that was about, and—trusting my gut—I asked if it was his girl best friend of 30 years. He panicked as soon as he realized what I was looking at. He tried to close the folder as quickly as possible, but it was already too late.

At first, he said it was nothing, just some porn he had watched the night before. But I didn’t believe him, and I kept pressing. Eventually, he admitted that yes, it was his best friend. She had sent him the photo to ask for his opinion on it because she was thinking of sending it to a guy.

I was devastated. Not only had he received that kind of photo (and I later found out it wasn’t the only one he got during our relationship), but he also saved it on his computer—for reasons I don’t even want to imagine. Worst of all, he lied to my face. And when I confronted him, he completely dismissed my feelings. He said what happened was “normal,” that it wasn’t cheating, and that I was overreacting—that I should just get over it.

Fast forward to now—I decided to give things another try, even though he wasn’t remorseful at all. I love him. But I’m finding it incredibly difficult to trust him again. I’ve been having nightmares about him cheating, and I feel anxious anytime he interacts with his female friends. 

Is what he did a normal thing between friends and im overreacting as he said? 

I don’t know what to do. I want to forgive him so badly and move forward, but it’s so hard. I need your advice.
How can I learn to trust him again?

My bf is very outgoing and talks to everyone, usually cracks jokes and is at times a chatter box. 

And I told him I want someone to take a pic of us, and we had a couple who was nearby us and I was confused why he didn’t just ask the tall man next to him to take some but instead asked this one girl who was very attractive, in sexy dress ( she looked good) but after she was done we said thank you and I thought we were going to walk away and he offers in turn to take her pictures… so he takes her coat and carries her purse and starts snapping photos of her while she poses and then says  “ oh beautiful”.. on one of her shots. He was just snapping away and I just stood there not sure of what to do. I felt so off about this and it made me so uncomfortable. 

And then when he handed her back her phone, purse and coat .. she  introduces herself to him and shakes his hand , and then he just points to me and says oh and this is (my name insert). And then that is as it. And he was just chuckling and having his drink and he asked me what was wrong. I didn’t even know how to answer him because I didn’t want to sound jealous or sound like he can’t even take pictures of someone, but I felt so disrespected. I did tell him I didn’t appreciate him doing that and he responded with “Do what”..And we got into an argument when we went back to the hotel. 

He did finally end up apologizing but man, I feel like what would prompt someone to do what he did. Almost like attention seeking towards another woman is how I am processing it and how will this reflect in his behavior 10 or 20 years down the road. I don’t want to sound or be someone to over react and I hope I am not over reacting. I can’t explain it in that moment I felt so small and so belittled, over looked .. all of it.

We have been married for 10 years. A week ago I was alerted he was having an online affair with someone in a video game and upon looking on his phone I discovered he was also secretly spending exorbitant amounts of money on a video game (Lastwar).  The total amount adds up to 40k in 6 months. 

He did not tell me any of this, it is all things I had to discover on my own which has added to the feelings of hurt with this incredible breach of trust. We have started seeing a counselor but I’m not sure if I should forgive him. 

We have had a fairly good marriage. Part of this however I feel is due to me continually lowering my expectations (for example I keep doing more household/child care duties, increase in outsource of hired help such as cleaning lady). I’m not sure if this is sustainable.  Previously I have told myself that I have to take the bad with the good. My husband is not the most ambitious guy but is someone you can count on to be fun and charming. 

Although it was just an online affair it still hurt to be betrayed in this way. What bothers me the most is the missing money. I feel like I was scammed by my own husband. 

To start moving past this, I told him I need him to figure out a way to pay me back the money he (pretty much) stole from our joint account. Because he doesn’t work I don’t know how he can repay me the money. 

I suggested he get a job and we will have to come up with a childcare plan. He is open to this but has not started looking for jobs yet that I know of and I’m not sure how feasible it is for us to get help with childcare. He asked his parents for the money and they were considering “loaning” him the money which again without him having a job doesn’t make a lot of sense. I got into an argument with his parents about it which was heated because of course no one wants to be responsible for this debt, them included. I admittedly asked for it too forcefully without loan attachments and behind my back they told my husband that they felt like I was blackmailing them. This label is frustrating and unfair and I subsequently made it clear to them that I don’t want their money anymore. 

Although I don’t truly need this money back financially, I need it back mentally. I am so hurt that my husband did this. 

We are going through counseling because at a minimum I figure I will need to learn to get past this to heal myself and we will need to be cordial for the kids. I don’t know if I should stay in the relationship though. I worry that I won’t be able to respect myself if I do forgive him.

There is a lot to this story but for simplicity sake I wont go to into to much detail. 
He has watched porn and played porn games since a young age, he has continued that into adulthood. We have been dating for almost 2 years now, we were long distance for about a year and a half of our relationship. We recently moved in together and are on month 4 of our 12 month lease. 
Before we moved in together we were already having issues in our sex life. I believe these issues stemmed from a porn addiction. Even now, he has not been able to finish during sex with me. Not once in our almost 2 year relationship have I seen him cum.
Before we moved in we had a talk, I told him I expected him to drop porn when we moved in together and that id prefer the sooner the better. He was upset but after sleeping on it he told me he would stop. However, I believe he never stopped, he lied to me about stopping. He mostly uses redit to watch porn while in the bathroom, thats just his method. When id ask him about it, he would pull up redit and go to the settings and the adult content filter would be off, he would say it ""turns on randomly"". Anytime I tried to have a conversation about it he would get combative and act like I was crazy for not believing him and taking him for his word. 
He also has multiple sex/henti games on his steam account. He originally told me they belonged to his brother because they used to share an account and he said he doesnt like them. I didnt believe him when he told me that but I didnt think much if it until recently.
Skip forward to now, I ended up finding out that he was still viewing and upvoting sexual content on redit actively. I confronted him about it and we got into a argument, he denied using it as fap material, he said he was only upvoting it, his exact words were ""oh tittys, nice! Like, scroll"". He ended up agreeing to stop again, he said I didnt make it clear that he wasnt allowed to like stuff like that only that he wasnt allowed to masterbate to porn (absolute bullshit, ive made it very clear i dont like him interacting with any kind of sexual content at all. He knows id be upset if he liked a bikini pic so he knows I wouldnt be okay with that). Anyway he ended up deleting his old redit account and creating a new one, he hasn't shown mw the new account so I cant be sure he isnt still looking at porn. 
However, what put me over the edge now is the porn games. He waits till I go to bed then he plays porn games. On all kinds of sites but the one Ive seen most is F95zone. That in itself pissed me off but then I found out he was playing porn moble games on his tablet in bed right next to me and trying to hide it. 
Im really at a loss here, I love him but all this is making me lose love and attraction to him. Now I look at him and all I see are the redit girls and henti games he likes. He hasnt cum during sex with me but he actively seeks outside sexual stimulation. We have talked before about him dropping sexual content to try to see if that will help but clearly he isnt willing to do that, only say he will then hide it from me. 
Idk what to do, talk with him again or just bid my time till things can end? I feel like we get no where with every conversation, he agrees then goes behind my back to continue and hide and lie to me. Saveable or no? Any advice on what to say? Any guys have experience with this? If so, what did your partner say to get you to stop?

sorry for the rant! I would just like to hear from some other women out there in the world and hear if you are all getting this amount of massages daily from your SO?",1770107339.0,,False,False,True,N/A,,False,False,False,False,False,0.77,N/A

I don't usually post on reddit, so I'm sorry if what I put down is gibberish.

I can't give an exact time on when this started to happen, but if I had to guess I'd say about 2 years ago? It only happens when we wind down not only at night but in the morning when we wake up too. I feel horrible and it's effecting my partner's self esteem, I don't blame him for the way it makes him feel. I don't know why this happens, but I always doze off when I'm the one performing and I always end up jolting and sometimes causing him discomfort. It makes it seem like I don't care about him or find him interesting which is the exact opposite of how I feel towards him. Even when I stand, walk around or wash my face it doesn't get better.

We've always been sexually active, even now after 6 years, but this is exhausting him. We recently had a baby, and because of that we've been relying on foreplay until I fully heal. And yeah, that means I've been dozing off more often. I hate this, I hate that I'm making him feel this way and I feel like a shitty partner. 

I do have an appointment with my OB next week and plan on discussing this with her. But in the meantime does anyone have any advice or experienced the same thing and how it was fixed?",1768574726.0,,False,False,True,N/A,,False,True,False,False,False,0.83,N/A

I was her first for anything sexual and she was my first for actual virginal sex. I love her so much and we really get each other. Yeah we disagree on some superficial things but we are always there for each other and we make each other happy. I know this sounds like I'm crazy because I'm young but we both feel like we have something special in this relationship. Everything is great accept for one problem, she seems to hate sex. We rarely do anything sexual, and when we do it's usually initiated by me (To be fair, when we got together she said that I would probably be the one initiating most the time because she gets nervous).

When stuff does start to happen, it's only hand stuff and kissing. She hates spit so gets grossed out my either of us doing head which is fair and i respect.

The thing is she has told me about kinks, she clearly gets turned on, she masturbaits, and we talk and plan sexual things we want to try. We also discuss what we don't like. I was worried that I just wasn't attractive to her, but she said that she does think I'm attractive, at feels turned on until I start working down there, she says it's really good at first then it starts to hurt. Anytime we try to do vaginal sex it really hurts her too. Because of this pain she has only orgasmed once by me.

So this sounds like vaginitis right? Easy fix, look up solutions or talk to a doctor. Well here is the problem. I try suggesting those and she shut them down. She said she don't need to be ""fixed"" but I just want her to feel good too. In fact she shuts down every idea I give. Mutual masturbaition, no because she wants masturbaition to be private, sex toys, no because the only time I could get them she tells me before the trip she doesn't want to do anything sexual.

I don't know what to do because she seems so into and so against it at the same time. It's driving me crazy because I want to do stuff, but I also want her to be comfortable, after all she doesn't need to take her clothes off for me to love her.

How can I make her comfortable and make us sexually happy? Has anyone dealt with anything like this before?

Edit: it's come to my attention that I wasn't fully aware what vaginitis is, I apologize and will do more research to better understand.

Also, we do foreplay, sometime it feels like it all that we do. She has told me before that I have taken too much time and she has lost the feeling. She also says that the foreplay can sometimes get repetitive and predictable. Problem is I don't want to be too forward and make her uncomfortable, like his going for it instead of asking if she wants to mess around.",1768093223.0,,1768094236.0,False,True,N/A,,False,True,False,False,False,0.76,N/A

And i’m getting sick of the load i have to do in the household. He doesnt do anything. Even when i ask 9 out of 10 times he doesnt even help me clean.

For example the only thing he does in the house occasionally is cooking and unloading or loading the dishwasher (only when i ask). I do the rest. He has a few nasty habits i dont like for example blowing his nose in his towels, peeing in the shower and he smears his boogers on the shower wall and doesnt clean them off. I dont want to clean them of either but everytime i bring it up he start gaslighting and says they arent even there. He always uses the excuse that he works more. And he does work more. I work 40 hour weeks and he maybe 50-60. But the thing is he doesnt have to work 50 hour weeks. Not for me at least. I’ve already brought this up to him. He wants to work more so he can start his own business and have a good network. And also i think he does it so he has an excuse not to do anything in the house.

I saw a lot of people say just dont do anything at all then. And the thing is he doesnt mind. If i dont wash our bed he doesnt mind. When he lived with his parents i found out he didnt wash his sheets for 3 months (i wish this was a joke). He just doesnt care if the house is clean or dirty. But i do so in the long run i am only pissing myself off.

And i thought maybe i am asking for too much (such as dont blow your nose in the towels). So i bought pink (mine) and blue (his) towels so he has his own and i have my own clean towels. But when he uses his he just throws them on te ground in a corner and they stay wet he then says he doesnt have any towels left and proceeds to use mine. Mind you he has 8 towels. I have 4. It is like living with a child and its making me crazy. It takes you like a second to just drape them on a hook so it will dry.

The relationship itself is also not great. When he drinks he constantly berates me is yelling at me and just says stuff to me i would never say to him because i know it would hurt him. The next day i’m mad and hurt and he doesnt know what he did or said to me. And its like this every time. Every time hes drunk he is so mean to me and he just says i cant help it i dont know what i do or say when i’m drunk. 

I really love him but these things are eating me alive and i dont want to start all over again or go live with my parents again if we part ways. Do you think he will ever change and respect me? How can i make this relationship good for the both of us? 

Edit: he got kicked out of his parents house because he was such a difficult person to live with according to his parents. So i feel bad if i leave he has to live here alone and the rent is pricey for one person.",1766489850.0,,1766491182.0,False,True,N/A,,False,False,False,False,False,0.92,N/A

He has a girl best friend and they know eachother from like 5th grade. They both liked eachother but never got to be together because he liked her first for a while and then moved on (with other girls and then me), and then she liked him.

When we started dating she had a boyfriend but apparently still got upset at the fact that we were together. He gave her a ride (she’s closer to his house) and when he got to my house she didn’t really switch to the back seat (or offered to), she went on the front seat alongside him the whole time until we got there. 

She didn’t really talk to me at all, even when I was trying to pick up conversation with her in the car ride to the friend’s party (it was the first time we met, as my boyfriend and were I starting to date). I met certain people that day that I’ve been “friends” with since that moment but she chose to seat from like a 8 feet distance in between us and didn’t engage in conversation with our side of the table.

Then, he had a fight with her that time about that, that he moved on so (as she supposedly did) but she didn’t act like she did. He also told me like their morals didn’t align anymore but now they seem to be doing OK.

She had other attitudes with me (like the other 3 times we saw eachother, because their friend group is no longer in contact with her, just my bf) but I don’t see her anymore.

She -up until this day- hasn’t even tried to get to know me, and to me that’s kind of sus because why wouldn’t you want to be close with your best friend’s girlfriend? That’s kind of a stupid move anyway because that could’ve broken them apart.

She honestly hasn’t really done anything to me since like 2023, but she also didn’t ever make any contact with me. 

He wouldn’t ever cheat on me or anything, that’s 110% sure. But I still find it weird that she never ever even followed me on insta or ever invited me to hang out with her and her new boyfriend and my boyfriend, or with my boyfriend and her. And ooooh boy, I tried to be the nicest person to her whenever I could.

My boyfriend told me they didn’t meet up by themselves (his friends don’t like her anymore) because I’m crazy (his words, repeatedly) and I wouldn’t take it right, but that’s a “me problem” because “I don’t know how to handle it”. Which, yeah, that thing I find suspicious would mess with my head!

How would you react in my place? Would you just let it go and tell him to meet with her whenever he wants and he won’t get an adverse reaction from me towards her?

I just want unbiased opinions so maybe I could know how to move forward.",1766316529.0,,False,False,True,N/A,,False,False,False,False,False,0.87,N/A

Before anyone jumps to conclusions this is not as a result of him cheating on me, he had a previous relationship which ended in February of this year and around that time this child was conceived. The mother had no clue she was pregnant the entirety of the pregnancy and also was coming up with negative tests. We've been dating since July and officially a couple as of November. This has come as a massive shock to absolutely everyone in involved as you can imagine. I've had 2 panic attacks and cried.... a lot. The baby is wanted and healthy, they are going to co-parent with the mom having custody as of right now but eventually he would like to move to 50/50. He has given me a way out if this is not something I want but I'm at a crossroads, I feel so young and unprepared (just as much as him) to get through supporting him in this time and also to eventually become a step-parent should our relationship develop over the years. I've been sick with worry and sadness as I feel this means our relationship will end. He is an amazing boyfriend and we've spoken about the future , however due to the short span of time we've been dating I can't wrap my head around whether this is a commitment that I could take on with him. I didn't sign up for this arrangement you know? I love him dearly and our relationship has been progressing so well and i'm super happy but I feel this could jeopardise our relationship and I'm worried that getting involved might put me in a bad position further down the line should we part ways or if he decides to get back with the mother of the baby.

I'm at a loss and would appreciate any advice.

UPDATE: Thank you everyone who responded, it really helped! It's been a little over a week, we still haven't seen each other in person but have made plans to on Monday. We just got off a long phone call, we both cried and talked about everything we felt and to make a long story short we've agreed that the best course of action is going to be to part ways. It's very upsetting as we've had a great relationship and ultimately it's down to timing. We're still going to be friends as we share similar interests and enjoy each other's company. We talked about the possibility of trying again in the future if we both want it but at this current point in time we cannot make both parties simultaneously happy. As unfortunate as this is, it feels like a weight has been lifted off my chest. I've been so stressed and anxious over trying to make a choice but now we've come up with an answer I immediately feel better.

We'll always love each other in some form and we both wish we were under different circumstances but this is our reality. I hope one day i'll be able to move on from this dreadful feeling and that I'll work past the trauma of the situation but for now i'm going to be happily single and spending more time with my friends and family and my cat :)

lots of love ❤️",1766028846.0,,1766883668.0,False,True,N/A,,False,False,False,False,False,1.0,N/A

Normally, I would be completely accepting and comfortable with this if it wasn’t for the fact that he’s mentioned how many women he’s been with multiple times. I’ve walked in on him masturbating and watching porn but when any sort of intimacy is aimed at me it feels lacking. When we are intimate it rarely lasts for more than a couple minutes before he decides he doesn’t want to continue and a majority of the time has to be planned in advance. If I try and be intimate with him on a whim it generally turns into me giving up trying and him practically ignoring my attempts. He claims he finds me attractive and loves me but never puts in any effort to actually make me feel that way. It leaves me with the feeling of wondering, what’s wrong with me compared to everyone else? Is he lying about being physically attracted to me? Is he turning to someone else to please him?

Lately, I’ve been feeling unhappy and unsure how to handle things.

Before I got pregnant, we both worked and split bills 50/50, but I was the one doing all the cooking, shopping, and cleaning. I constantly had to nag him to help. Now that I’m a SAHM, I of course handle all of the household responsibilities — but nothing has really changed. When he gets home from work (8am–6pm), he will help with our son, which I appreciate, but he doesn’t help with anything around the house. It’s a 4-bedroom, 2-bathroom home, plus all the laundry, cooking, errands — and I’m also running two small businesses daily. Conversations don’t get anywhere; he’ll change for a day then slip back.

The second big issue is drinking. A couple weekends ago, he almost drank himself to death (I made a post about that). I’m not angry about that specific night, but it’s part of a bigger pattern. Earlier this year:
	•	He crashed his truck in a ditch while drunk with his best friend and then lied about it until his friend told me.
	•	He once took my car in the middle of the night, drunk, with our son’s car seat still in it, and drove 30 minutes away.

I feel like his friendship with this friend comes first sometimes.

We started couples therapy last week. The therapist and I both pointed out how he doesn’t actually hear my feelings — he makes excuses or deflects — and he got defensive. He says I don’t acknowledge him either. He’s also in individual therapy because he’s extremely emotionally unavailable. For context: he is loyal, hardworking, and a great dad. But emotionally and communicatively, it’s a wall.

Then today, what set me off: we have two outdoor cats (not my choice — I’d have them inside). One went missing, and I found her dead in the driveway. My husband had hit her on his way to work and didn’t even tell me. When I said I wanted to bury her nicely, he stormed off saying I was acting like it was his mom and being ridiculous, and that I should just throw her in the ditch. I was crying and upset all evening, and instead of comforting me, he got mad. Now I’m worried about the other cat, but he won’t allow her inside. I’m leaning toward rehoming her just so she’s safe, even though I love her.

I guess I’m just… lost. I don’t know how much of this is normal stress in marriage/parenthood, how much is deeper incompatibility, or if therapy can truly help us.

Even though he slept with more people than me, (~16) and I slept with 10, he is judging me because he “only” had two hookups, one of which was apparently a threesome and possibly a foursome at age 19 (he was too drunk to remember), and I had 4.

He is judging me for having hookups/ situationships four years ago, and he's saying that it's different from what he had because the things that he had just “happened” and the things I did are a “deliberate choice”, and he believes that for women the urge to sleep around is different from men because men are pressured to do it by society, and for women it's more of an emotional need, so if a woman has slept around with many people, it means she may have emotional problems. 

I feel like he's implying that I'm a slut and slut-shaming me and I don't think he understands it. I had a very gentle conversation with him, trying to understand what he means by saying that after I told him about my past, he said he moved past it, I tried to unpack what that means, and he said he doesn't love it and that it's different from what he did, but he moved on from it. The fact that he said that he moved on from it makes me feel like he's moving on from me being a slut. This makes me not want to touch him and just feel insecure about doing anything sexual with him, and we already have fights in this relationship and doubts about compatibility. What is your opinion on this?

Update: We broke up. He was apologetic about potentially being hurtful and said I “cornered” him into a discussion he didn’t wanna have, and that he doesn’t judge me. However I ended it anyway due to the other differences between us, he was upset and said he wishes it worked out, but he understood.

I 29/F married to 31/M went searching through his WhatsApp messages. 

I already know it's wrong. We were shopping together, getting things for his parents. The entire time he was on his phone, he casually mentions he was talking to two of his coworkers about different things one male age unknown and the other 24/F. While messaging with the female coworker he keeps a little distance from me and when screen out of my view (while I pick up necessities for his parents). He mentions that she is having an issue with another male coworker, I shrug it off and say ""that sucks"", and leave it there. When that conversation is apparently over he is gets much closer to me lock step while he continues messaging the male coworker, his screen in full view, even when I deliberately walk away from him he comes closer to making sure I can view his screen.

Today I ask for his phone to transfer some photos from a recent trip. I decided to send them through Whatsapp (we always share photos this way, plus we also use it for our messaging as well). I open Whatsapp to see my chat and a bunch of others, the male coworker he was chatting with but not the female. 

I did some googling and found out you can lock chats on Whatsapp and you need a secret code or biometrics to access the locked and hidden chat. I was searching everywhere for this female he mentioned, it wasn't there.


He caught me snooping and got upset, said I don't trust him. I said well why is that chat deleted? He replied because I snoop and people share private stuff with him. I said why would I care about private information about people I don't know. He said he respects people's privacy. He also continued to say he gives me his password to everything and always tells me where he is at all times. I said you can always say where you are it means nothing if I don't believe you. 

He is hurt I don't trust him..... In the past he has accused me of cheating multiple times the latest accusations was about 4 weeks ago. Me thinking about all the accusations is what made me want to snoop.

What was the better way to go about handling the suspiciously missing chat from this female coworker?

Update: He has been cheating for over a year with someone else not even the co-worker. I confronted him, he lied, denied then eventually admitted. Currently asking me to work it out

We have been together on an off since I was 18 and he was 20 (things were complicated when I had my daughter as we were young and he didn’t want a child, we got back together 3 years ago and things have mostly been good since). 

We decided to start trying for a second baby in January (a decision we made together and are both excited for). I am now 16 Weeks pregnant. I have had a few issues during this pregnancy and am currently under investigation for ongoing arrhythmia and irregular heartbeat which I have found very tiring. 

I am a teacher so am currently off school on Summer Holidays, so have our daughter in the day. My partner has a hernia which he is finally getting looked at after 4 years which needs operating on. He has put off seeing a doctor about it for so long that it is now massively affecting daily life. He cannot play with our daughter properly and cannot walk far or be stood out for long periods of time without discomfort. He is constantly having to push the hernia back in. This has also massively affected our sex life (which is basically non existent at the minute). 

The issue:

Due to him not being able to walk far without pain or discomfort he has asked me to drop him off and 
Pick him up from the train station each day when he goes to/ comes back from work. The station is a 10 minute walk away or 5 mins in the car. This means me and my daughter having to get up at 7am to get him to the station. We share a car so if I don’t get up to drop him he drives to the station which means we don’t have a car for the day and so are limited to what we can do and end up stuck in the house. That isn’t fair on my daughter so of course I drop him. 

My pregnancy and heart issues has been making me extremely tired to the point where by the evenings I feel like I’ve been hit by a bus I’m that tired. Once we put our daughter to bed (after picking him up from the station at 7pm) we make dinner and have dinner and watch tv. We massively struggle on finding a series we both like so he usually lets me out what I’m currently watching on while we are eating and then we go up to bed not long after dinner at about 9pm. I’ll continue watching my show on the iPad in bed until about 10pm and then go to sleep. At this point he will turn the tv in our bedroom on and watch his show. I find it really hard to go to sleep with the TV on. 

This is something I’ve dealt with over the years but now I’m pregnant I’m finding it really hard and will fall asleep but toss and turn and wake up multiple times because of the tv. He usually watches it until at least midnight. I am also waking up continuously through the night which means I’m even more tired when I have to get up and out at 7am to drop him to the station. 

I have asked if he can watch his show on the iPad so it’s not as bright or watch it in the living room so I can sleep but he won’t. He says that it’s his house too and he should be able to watch tv in bed if he wants too. 

I’m getting to the point where it’s just p*ssing me off. I feel like I just can’t sleep! I’m either kept up in the evening or being made to get up early in the mornings. This means in the day I end up having to have a nap which isn’t fair on my daughter as she’s then stuck entertaining herself for 40 minutes. We had a play date the other day and I was so exhausted throughout and by the end that it’s made me worry about doing anything in the afternoons because of how exhausted I am. I only have a week left before I go back to work and I want to feel rested, not exhausted when I go back. 

On top of all this, he is expecting me to do all the cleaning, cooking, food shopping etc. When he was on garden leave a couple of months ago he expected us to share all of that and that was with him not even having our daughter at home with him because she was at school! 

What is the solution here? I just don’t know what to do but I can’t keep going like this. To me it just doesn’t seem fair that I’m being kept up till silly o’clock and then woken up early on top of that and then expected to function in the day. 

Please give me some advice! I just don’t know what to do or whether I’m being unreasonable.

I share 50/50 custody of my young son, who’s in daycare and soon starting kindergarten (still needing before/after school care). I work full-time, pay half of daycare, and cover my own expenses.

When we moved in together, we agreed I’d help with bills. Right before moving in, I bought a car — he’s been upset about it ever since, and it comes up every time we talk about money. I do have some debt, but life happens. I still need gas, lunch, and essentials for my son. I have to stay afloat, but I feel like I’m drowning. My anxiety is through the roof.

At home, I work the same hours he does, yet I’m the one cooking most nights, doing dishes, laundry, cleaning, and trying to keep things together for my son. I’m starting to think I might be depressed.

Recently, a small conversation about my morning alarm turned into him getting frustrated and making me feel stupid. He’s admitted before that he thinks he’s the reason his past relationships failed, and I’m starting to see patterns. He also struggles with drinking and only wants to have serious talks when he’s been drinking.

Last night, he asked if I was using him. I’m not — I love him deeply. I know the financial stress is heavy on him, but I’m overwhelmed, sad, and feeling defeated. I even picked a fight last night out of frustration, which I regret.

I’m not trying to take advantage of him. I’m just stuck, exhausted, and unsure how to move forward. Any advice would be appreciated. Please keep the mean comments to yourself — I cannot handle it right now.

TL;DR: My boyfriend thinks I’m using him because I can’t contribute as much financially as he wants. I’m drowning in debt, household responsibilities, and anxiety, and I’m worried I’m losing myself in the process. ",1755270664.0,,False,False,True,N/A,,False,False,False,False,False,1.0,N/A

We’ve been together for 5years now. We have a kid together and one on the way. 
Last year I moved out of his home without telling him due to the physical abuse he put me through ever since we found out we were pregnant with our first. After having our first child his parents put a temporary restraining order on me to try and take my daughter from me. They thought I was cheating with my first child’s father because he would work on my car for free (because I was his child’s mother). They put in the restraining order that I was homeless and that I’d abused my husband physically. They were granted this temporary order with no proof. I then went on to hire a lawyer and with proof that he’d been physically abusive towards me and tried to run me over with his car they were forced to drop the restraining order. 
After moving into my own place and splitting up we both seen other people. I had our child full time and he only ever had her twice within this time frame. He would never ask how she was or to see her. If I sent photos of her he wouldn’t say anything. 
We ended up staying apart for awhile then slowly got back together. He seemed different. Like he actually cared and wanted to be involved. He didn’t call me names anymore. He didn’t hit me. He wasn’t talking to other girls behind my back. He’d done all the things to make me believe that he was different. 
So we got married and we tried for another baby. Everything was perfect. We bought a house. Got a joint bank account. Then we found out I was pregnant and he started to hit me again and call me names and stopped helping out with the kids. He’d complain every time my son was over. 
I’ve come completely detached from him. I have no feelings towards time other than hate. 
Our first child we weren’t married when I had her so I didn’t put him on the birth certificate and I want out of my marriage before I have this child. 
He’s made it obvious that he doesn’t like children. 
I want to leave. I just don’t know how. 
I can’t stand him anymore. I hate being around him. I refuse to sleep with him or for him to touch me. 
We share a house and a bank account. Idk what to do. ",1752648124.0,,False,False,True,N/A,,False,False,False,False,False,0.88,N/A

My husband and I shortly after getting married starting having some difficult conversations as my husband said he wanted to sleep with other women. It led to long nights of fights, and led to me finding out I was pregnant. Those conversations about sleeping with other women always continued and I always shut it down. I had an “oopsie” moment when my daughter turned 1, and found out I was pregnant with our second. 

Fast forward - we now have a 2.5 year old and a 9.5 mo old. Most recently, my husband went through my phone and found flirtatious texts from my boss. Nothing has ever happened with me and my boss, but he does make flirtatious comments now and then that I usually change the subject on. My husband is CONVINCED that I have slept with my boss because of this. He tells me that I am full of shit and that he could sense something was different/off with me. 

The thing is, there has been something off with me. I recently went on a girls trip where I left my kids with their grandparents and their dad for 4 days, and it was magnificent. I felt free and was so glad to have some time to myself. This was my first and only girls trip. My husband thinks something happened on the girls trip too. But that’s the thing - NOTHING HAPPENED. We partied and went home. I was never alone and it never crossed my mind to even try something. But it was great to not have to be home and cook, clean, and pick up other people’s messes for a weekend. 

My husband is convinced I’ve cheated on him, whether it was on my girls trip or with my boss and he says he is unsure if he can move forward in our marriage. Part of me does not want to lose him, and the other part is feels like the marriage was doomed from the start.

Over the last year her family has explicitly stated I cannot go to their family events (birthday parties, lunches, etc). The answers I have been given why are I haven't been affectionate enough with her at their events, they didn't like my vibe, and that I didn't provide a good enough house for our daughter (we lived in an 800sqft 1bd apartment in a VHCOL area when born and now live in a rented 2bd condo. Safe neighborhood and good schools). I told my GF than unless I'm invited I don't want my children going to their events, and going would be a choice of them over me. 

Some background on this is how little I feel like she appreciates my family. The first time she met some of my cousins was on a wine weekend where she got too drunk and cried for several hours and split the group up so I could stay with her to calm down. She ruined Thanksgiving 2yr ago and made us leave because my mother didn't have a baby gate up. She airtagged the diaper bag after my mother and me took my daughter to a zoo for the first time without her. She will not talk to my mother anymore  because she wouldn't delete a photo from my son's bris of my father and uncle holding the baby (fully clothed). My mother provides us lots of help, she helped watch the kids while I was on a trip with my father and then the next weekend while my GF was away on a girls trip, and her father is close by and could have helped. In spite of all these run-ins my cousins still threw her a baby shower and invite her to events even without me.

We’ve been together just under a year.I'm currently about 20 weeks pregnant — this was very much a surprise.
We love each other.I’m extremely introverted, slow to open up, pretty private with my emotions.He’s extroverted, very high-energy, full of ideas and optimism — but not always great at reading emotional cues unless I spell things out clearly.
It took me a long time to fully embrace this pregnancy.My background is complicated — childhood emotional neglect, a very abusive marriage in my early 20s, and other stuff I won’t get into here — and trusting someone enough to build a family with them has been the scariest and bravest thing I’ve ever done.
For the last few months, it’s felt like things were stabilizing.I didn’t find out the gender of the baby on purpose — I wanted to stay connected to the baby as a soul, not risk getting caught up in expectations.I’ve been trying to trust my body, trust the process.He’s been sweet — bringing me food, being cuddly, telling people he’s excited.I even started secretly thinking about maybe taking his last name one day, which is something I've never considered before.
But now something has shifted. And it feels really, really bad.

Here’s the background:
We had talked, lightly, earlier in the relationship about maybe including another woman someday — like a threesome or something casual. I’m bisexual and have been curious before, but it was always a very ""someday if it feels right"" thing.It wasn’t a current plan. It wasn’t urgent.
While I was cleaning the house getting ready for a friend [20sF] to come over for dinner last week (someone we’d lightly flirted with once before — ENTJ vibes for anyone who cares), he casually joked about ""getting the bed ready too.""
I just froze.
Here I am — pregnant, moving slower, exhausted, trying to make our home welcoming — and he’s making jokes about prepping the bed...?
I brushed it off because dinner was about to happen and I didn’t want to kill the vibe.But honestly, it lodged somewhere deep inside me.It didn’t feel funny.It felt like something cracked.

And then it got worse.
Now there’s a new interest [30F] in the picture (very ESFJ — bubbly, nurturing, affectionate) who he’s started talking about a lot more seriously.Not just casually.Like... ""perfect second wife material"" talk.
He keeps reassuring me that I'll always be ""queen bee.""But it doesn’t feel like reassurance — it feels like being pre-emptively sidelined.
And the timing just feels... awful.
I’m halfway through a pregnancy.I’m physically vulnerable.I’m emotionally cracked wide open.I’ve been doing everything I can to keep my body and spirit steady.And instead of locking in with me and the baby, it feels like he’s already shopping around.
I even said at one point — cool cool cool I’m not even your first wife.
He laughed.I didn’t.

Other context:He has a group of female ""admirers"" who have always been passive-aggressive toward me when he’s not around.When I bring it up, he tells me not to worry about it.
At this point, it doesn’t feel random.It feels like a pattern.

Where I'm at now:I was excited about birth.I was excited about my doula friend staying with me afterward.Now I don’t even want her here.I just want to be alone.I want everything and everyone far away so I can protect myself and my baby.

Would really appreciate any advice — especially from anyone who's been through complicated relationship stuff or knows what healthy open dynamics are supposed to look like.
Thanks for reading.

TL;DR: 
20 weeks pregnant. Was finally starting to feel safe and excited. Now my boyfriend is joking about threesomes and seriously talking about a second wife. I feel crushed.",1745838700.0,,False,False,True,N/A,,False,False,False,False,False,0.74,N/A

We have a house and also another property together that we are fixing up. We have spoken about marriage several times in the past, we’ve even got quotes on venues a few years back but it just was all so expensive so we left it. 

Yesterday I was scrolling on Facebook and I saw a post from a local bridal company offering affordable venue hire for the ceremony and also includes the officiant, photography and 10 guests. Anyway I messaged the company just asking some clarifying questions and I spoke to my partner about it last night. I said that I really want to get married before my dad passes as he has terminal cancer (my partner knows this and I’ve expressed it previously). He just nodded his head and I said I really think we should go look at the venue see what dates they have for early 2027 and then go speak to my parents. He just nodded and seemed to agree. I then said well when is a good day for you, I’ll message them and book a time to go look at it. At this point he back peddled and was like “you’ve just sprung this on me” I said well have been together for over 10 years and have spoken about it before and then he said “I need to think about it for a few days”. TBH I was kinda shocked. I thought he’d be all in. What is there to think about? Does he not want to marry me? I’m so confused.

I can’t really bring this up again until a few days because I want to respect his boundary. ",1768259000.0,,False,False,True,N/A,,False,False,False,False,False,0.92,N/A

My Girlfriend If Perfect. In every way. Body, face, heart, intellect, humor, the list goes on. She is the most beautiful woman on earth, and I will willingly fight anyone who says otherwise. 

Lately though, after being together for two years, she has started to get very self conscious about her breasts, then yesterday despite my frequent -Almost excessive- compliments and shows of affection towards them, she told me in confidence that she wants to get implants, and is planning on discussing it with her family over the holidays. I tried to react as neutrally as possible to her thoughts, but I tried to air on more positive despite what I felt. 

I’m not going to describe what my girl’s chest looks like, because that’s irrelevant. It is beautiful and attached to an indescribably beautiful woman. And I do not understand why they would need to be modified. 

There are two things though that really bother me. One: She said she wanted this “for myself and for you \\\[me\\\]”. What the HELL have I done or not done to make her think I was anything short of completely obsessed and enthralled with every cell on her body? 

Two: this is the latest symptom of what seems to be an almost pathological insecurity this  gorgeous woman has. Despite the evidence presented by myself and everyone who loves her, she seems to see herself as having the appearance of a Tolkien creature. 

Selfishly, I hate the idea of looking at ugly, synthetic parts on an otherwise perfect woman.

Most people would call my taste in literature... boring. Biographies. Histories. College lectures. I decided to shake it up by reading a smutty MM romance novel last week.

  


And it broke me. It sent me to high highs and low lows. I was (and am) depressed, turned on, empty, emotional, and have a bunch of other feelings. I still can't sleep well. I can't stop thinking about the two main characters and their intense emotional and sexual connection. In many ways it's the perfect book. I want to read it again. I also want to burn it.

  


I don't know why I feel this way. My best guess is that I'm subconsciously comparing my own marriage to a fictional relationship between two hot guys in their 20s (which is stupid). I also have never really read or watched a lot of MM media, and perhaps there's something coming to the surface there.

  


I need.... something. I don't know what to do. I discussed this with my husband and he was sympathetic but also doesn't quite know what I should do. Therapy? Read more smutty romances until I get desensitized? Ask him to read it too and roleplay?  One long weekend alone where all we do is tell each other ""I love you"" and have sex? I'm just lost.

Since the birth of our second child, the question of contraception has become a big topic between us. My wife insists that I get a vasectomy because it is less invasive than sterilization for women. She doesn’t want to take the pill anymore and doesn’t fully trust condoms.

I understand her reasoning, but I feel pressured into a surgery I’m not emotionally ready for. I’m 35, and I’m not at the point where I want to close the door on having another child completely. I know she doesn’t want a third child, and I respect that. Under normal circumstances I have no intention of being with another woman, but I also don’t know what life will look like in 2–3 years.

Our discussions have reached a point where we’ve stopped having sex, which is obviously an unsatisfying situation for both of us. Right now I don’t know what to do. I’m fully willing to take responsibility for birth control, but as a man I really only have two options: condoms or a vasectomy. Unfortunately there’s still no “male pill” available.

Hi everyone,
I’m not sure how to even word this, but I really need some outside perspective.

My boyfriend (23M) and I (22F) have been together for about 3–4 years and living together for 1 year. For the past two years, I’ve had zero interest in anything sexual. I don’t want sex, I don’t enjoy it, and I don’t really feel drawn to anything sexual at all.

This is very different from how I used to be. Earlier in our relationship (and even before it) I enjoyed sexual things and had a normal sex drive. But as I’ve grown older, something shifted. Now sex just feels… uncomfortable, unenjoyable, and honestly like a chore. It doesn’t feel good physically or mentally. I don’t feel disgust or trauma — I just feel nothing.

My boyfriend has been patient to a point. He never forces anything, he can go months without sex, and he tries to be understanding. But recently he’s been getting frustrated and sad. He says things like: “You don’t love me,” “You’re not attracted to me,” or “I can’t go on like this forever.” I understand why he feels this way, even though none of it is true.

I do love him. I am attracted to him. I just don’t get any pleasure from sex anymore, and it honestly wouldn’t bother me if I never had sex again. But it’s obviously hurting him, and this is becoming a constant point of tension and arguments.

I don’t know what to do. I don’t know if something is wrong with me hormonally, mentally, emotionally… or if I’m just someone who doesn’t really need sex. In my day-to-day life it doesn’t bother me at all, but in a relationship it clearly becomes a problem.

Has anyone experienced this? Has anyone been in a relationship where one partner basically has no libido? How do you deal with it? I’m scared this will eventually destroy what we have.

Any advice would help.

Every time we get into those kinds of conversations, she either dismisses what I say, acts like I don’t know what I’m talking about, or gets irritated if I try to correct her.

Usually, these topics come up because they’re trending ( we’ll see something in a YouTube video, a short, or on TikTok ) and that’s how the conversation starts in the first place. A lot of these same topics also come up at her job (beacuse they are trending), and this is where we get to the issue.

**What frustrates me most** is that weeks or even months later, she’ll bring up the *exact same thing* I told her before. But this time, she’ll say something like, “Oh, my coworker told me this,” or “Did you know that…?” and present it as if it’s brand-new information. No mention that I’d already said it, no acknowledgment at all.

To make it worse, sometimes she’ll repeat things that aren’t even accurate but because a “smart person” from her job said it, she takes it as fact.

It’s honestly exhausting. It makes me feel like my opinions or knowledge don’t count unless someone else especially someone from her work validates them first.

However, lately it has felt like I watch porn because I'd rather be having sex but can't get it, and my partner isnt in the mood because he has already satisfied himself. We have talked about it. He is going to therapy and working on himself. Up until tonight I felt like he was really trying. We have been together for 8 years.

He is out of town and left the notes on his computer open. He is comfortable with me using his computer to play games and such since i dont have a desktop, so I got on.  I saw one note with my ring size and that made me happy. Then I saw another note that was blank.

I had a feeling that meant something was there he didn't want me to see and curiosity got the better of me.I have some abandonment issues and have snooped in the past, found some silly only fans stuff and he got upset with me for snooping, which is reasonable. I knew I shouldn't have done it but we are beyond that point now. What I found was an IMPRESSIVE number of links, downloads, usernames for only fans and fansly... I had previously told him I believed chatting with or paying them when in a relationship is crossing a line. Lots of leak download links so, I'm guessing he's not paying. That's good.

Then I saw a lot of taboo stuff... extreme taboo stuff. Stuff I kind of knew he was into and stuff I don't think I can disclose. It wasn't illegal but it was as close as you could probably get before crossing the line.

We had been talking about next steps and a timeline to buy a house and start a family. I am now paranoid it would not be safe to do so based on the type of content I found. The only cope I have is that it wasn't ALL like that. 

I am pretty skeptical of porn addiction as a concept in general but at this point I'm kind of hoping that's what this is, because if it's not just the thrill of taboo that's getting him off, then the reality is much worse. I wish I could go back in time and never see it. Before anyone suggests talking about kinks and trying it, I have done that. I am very open to it, maybe even unintentionally enabling his unhealthy fixation. I can understand why he wouldn't tell me about all of his interests, though. This was very shocking for me to find. I'm not sure how much I can describe without violating the rules so, if that gives you any idea, yeah. Disclaimers at the start about them being actors. It was a lot more than the usual taboo stuff you'd see on a vanilla site, I'm sure it would get removed.

All that being said, I called him to confront him about it and he was extremely remorseful. I wanted to wait until he was home but I couldn't stop thinking about it. He said he doesn't want things to end and even messaged me saying he is coming home early, which I feel bad about. I'm sure he's panicking. He said he has played out in his head how this conversation will go before, so he knows it's wrong. I'm sure the guilt has wished on him and the way he phrased it makes me wonder if its a compulsion? It is very difficult for me not to coddle him after we have to discuss a relationship issue whether I was wrong or him, and I'm worried I'll do that again this time when he says he is sorry in person. I don't want to do that while still being hurt deep down. I need some kind of resolution here or I fear I will break down and end something that has been good for a long time.

 I don't even know what to ask for to rebuild our trust at this point. I dont think it's fair to ban porn outright. I am bi so I watch it myself, but not nearly as often. He swears it's nothing he'd ever actually do in real life. I don't know what to think... it scared me. I want to be open minded, but it scared me.  I want to know if I'm crazy or if there is a way to come back from this. I love him dearly. We have been planning so much together. Aside from all this he is very good to me, probably the best thing that has ever happened to me. I want us both to continue to grow and make each other better people but I realize I can't just ""fix him"" either. We were both abused as children and it's something we relate to one another about, I am wondering if this has anything to do with it. I don't  think he ever would've told me if I didn't find it. Please tell me the hard truth or help me figure out how I move forward from here.",1752379430.0,,False,False,True,f4bfa566-39f0-11f0-9fac-5e63307d9f14,Locked - OP Deleted Account ,True,True,False,False,False,0.82,N/A

Long story short she comes home plastered at 2am to the point I think she’s drugged. I miss placed my phone and used hers to call mine and see in her phone that she called a “Sargent smash”. Researching further into it I find out this is her old bf and his name is obviously not that. When she gets this drunk she hardly remembers anything from the night prior so I confronted her about it and she says oh I probably just called him to talk shit. To me this is a total cross over my boundaries but she just brushed it off as “I was talking shit.” 

She’s a bartender and often text many of her regulars which would be fine if it’s platonic but some of these men are obviously wanting to get with her and she entertains the attention it seems which is another boundary crossed for me and I’ve made that fact known.

Don't know where to go from here.

Husband (33) me/wife (27) both Bisexual.

My husband and I have been together for 9 years, married for 2. In the beginning our sex life was great. It was consistent (multiple times a week) then over time it slowed to maybe 2-3 times a month. But for the last 6 months, husband hasn't initiated even ONCE. This is something our relationship has always struggled with. Husband is still affectionate, hugs/snuggles, hand holding, caring, supportive. But no sex. 

He's never had a huge sex drive, he has blamed this on ADHD medication that he took as a child, that it messed his hormones up? Regardless, he insists that he just doesn't 'get the urge' or 'im not wired to same why you are' 

90% of the time during our relationship, I'm the one who will suggest being intimate. However the last year or so, it feels like whenever I do ask, I'm forcing him to complete a chore. It feels robotic, I feel like most days I'm trying to schedule it in like a meeting.

He and I are both overweight, so sex usually looks like mutual masturbation, making out, and maybe ending with penetration OR oral. (Speaking of oral, he refuses to give it. Very early on in our relationship, he complained that every time he did, he would get an eczema rash, so I havent received oral in about 8 years.)

A large part of our intimacy involved kink related aspects, as well as roleplaying or him explaining a situation/fantasy of his. This would always include other people, taboo situations. Naturally as we are both kinky, this would be fine, however it got to a point in our relationship (last 12 months) when I realised that it was EVERYTIME we had sex, he had to involve mentioning another women. This coupled with the fact he never wants to initiate sex with me, has made me feel that he doesn't actually want me sexually. I feel like the only thing keeping him somewhat interested in sex was living out fantasies of involving another woman. Since I brought this up to him (on the night of our anniversary early this year) he has completely stopped initiating sex. I think since March, we've had sex 3 times.

I've tried different approaches in the bedroom, I'm naturally a very submissive person, but I've tried switching it up which he enjoyed, but I feel like I'm doing things I don't enjoy just to feel intimate with him. 

I feel so incredibly isolated from him, I feel unwanted and undesired. I feel rejected. I've emotionally checked out somedays, I resent him sometimes which I hate. The slightest hint of intimacy sends me over the edge, and when I'm constanly rejected I feel like dying inside. My heart aches for us, that our relationship is how it is. But I love him so much, he's my protector, my best friend, we've been through so much together.

I do know 100% he had never been with someone before me and that he's being truthful. I was even his first kiss etc. He's always had a hard time connecting with people until he went to therapy and now he's really come out of his shell! He let me know about 2 years ago he had a porn addiction but stopped watching it for good around August 2023. He did admit there was a few times he did cave in and watch it but never like he used to. He also let me know, he never ""touched himself"" in the traditional way a man would. He would basically hump the floor? Like rub himself on the ground until he finished. That's the only way he was ever able to reach an orgasm. I try and not be judgmental, we've all done our weird little horny things before. He has never been able to ""finish"" in any other way. We've had sex multiple times now and he's never able to finish. It's great sex but, it's kind of getting to me... He'll also get soft a lot during it and oral. Like it'll be raging and then limp randomly. I've only had one partner before him. I am able to get R hard easily, like even from a simple kiss or a touch so I know he's attracted to me, but man idk what to do. I'm not angry with him or anything, but I'm wondering how this is going to affect our relationship long term. We both go to therapy and are very honest with one another, but I'm not sure how this is going to work sometimes. It's not like i'm sex obsessed but, it's conflicting. I'm not sure if he has a bad problem with porn still or how we can mend this issue. ",1750797429.0,,False,False,True,N/A,,False,True,False,False,False,0.87,N/A

I asked her how many people she had slept with during our break.

At first she said one which you know isn't that big a deal we were separated, but then I asked if she lied she did she said two, I asked her twice if she had lied before landing on the number 3, I then asked for the names of these people since I know a lot of people around our age and I just started working at a bar she worked at, and it would be weird if it was any we were working with. she refused to tell me saying that she owed me nothing due to us not being together and that I didn't need to know. After this we argued a little and ended up going to sleep.

I woke up in the morning and went to work I spent the whole morning going back and forth messaging, her until I finally said, you either give me the names or we're split. she persisted and said she wasn't giving names, so I went and grabbed me stuff from her house and as I was grabbing them, she told me the names.

I was mad that the secrecy of what were just a couple of flings meant more to her then our relationship. I then messaged one of my close friends asking for advice because I was just in shambles, I really liked this girl but the secrecy and everything just rubbed me the wrong way. Then went to my dad for some advice and he told me just to cool off and just talk about it which we did I ended up staying at her house talking about it and we kind of breezed over it.

I wake up in the morning and she's standing over the top of me, my stuff in her hands.

she said I can't believe that you would go behind my back and talk to one of your close friends about this and then sleep in my bed. While i was asleep she had gone on my phone read my messages with my friend and accused me of slut shaming her, the friend was female, and we actually talked about the secrecy and the lying. i feel hurt and disrespected.",1750406842.0,,1750424592.0,False,True,N/A,,False,True,False,False,False,0.66,N/A

I didn't read/give her the letter. Instead, I just gently opened up a conversation with her about what I saw. Guess what? She completely denied it so the conversation didn't go very far.

I said you weren't doing anything wrong, there's nothing to be ashamed of, it's your right to do that, etcetera, but she maintained that what I saw -- plain as day -- with my own two eyes didn't actually happen so... I just let it go and we sat in awkward silence for awhile until she changed the subject. We talked for awhile and I came home.

I am going to break up with her so she can find someone who is more attuned to her needs. I don't think we are sexually compatible. I am very open about sex. I don't think it's something to be ashamed of, and I have no problem having open conversations about it.

I just started a new job that can be very stressful, especially since I am learning/new to everything about it, and it’s very overwhelming. Also, I haven’t been getting hardly any sleep for over a month (I am exhausted ALL day but as soon as my head hits the pillow I am wide awake), which a lot of it probably has to do with all the moving/stress of a new job/my anxiety with all of that. However, because I am so sleep deprived and have been so anxious, my emotions have been all over the place.

Just a couple weeks ago, he also started a new and very stressful job- we are both in the same situation where we went into these jobs knowing pretty much nothing. I know that he has a lot on his plate right now, so I’ve been trying not to burden him with everything that goes on in my head. But Tuesday of this week I broke down a bit and texted him how I feeling so off and lost with all the new changes. Last night I started crying simply because I cannot sleep for the life of me and I have tried so many things to help. He is 100% convinced that it’s because of my ADHD medication (Vyvanse) that I take during the week for work.

Background: I’ve been on this medication for almost three years and it has helped me SO much in multiple areas of my life. I was on 60mg during college and I have dropped to 50 and planned to continue going down (mainly because my boyfriend hates the medication, blames everything on the medication, constantly reminds me about health issues that can happen w it, etc.). Even on the higher dosage, I did not have issues sleeping unless I was super anxious/had a lot going on. 

Anyways, he got upset at me because he says that I put too much on him and that he has so much going on with his new job that he can’t take on all my problems at the same time. I didn’t handle it all too well, the situation escalated, and I told him to leave me alone. A while later he came back into the room to apologize, but his apology consisted of “I’m sorry I was mean to you, I treated you that way because…” so he basically defended why he treated me poorly. I told him that isn’t a sincere apology if he is just going to defend himself (which again, maybe I should have just accepted it and moved on, idk), but it escalated again and he walked out.

Five minutes later he came into the room again and said that I either stop taking Vyvanse or he is will end things with me, and then walked out. I got up to go to the bathroom, decided to check the medicine cabinet, and found that he had taken and hidden it. I ended up calling my friend to ask her what I should do in this situation, and she said that is not right for him to do that, that it’s controlling, and that she will come and pick me up in five. I have no idea what’s right or wrong or what is and isn’t okay since I didn’t have the greatest models for what a relationship should look like while growing up, but I agreed that this isn’t something I should put up with so I started to pack up an overnight bag. My boyfriend walked into the room while I was packing and when I told him where I was going he told me I can’t leave. He also proceeded to tell me that me telling my friends things that go wrong in our relationship is toxic and that sharing our personal issues is so messed up. He stated that he is going to keep my meds until I beg for them back so that I can see “how addicted I am to them”… 

To sum up my huge spiel (and thank you to anyone who has read to here), I realized this morning that he has taken my personal medication, which is a schedule II controlled substance. My psychiatrist even says that this certainly isn’t okay and that I should call the non emergency police hotline since it is illegal for him to take it. I don’t know if I should go to that extent, especially because I would feel too embarrassed having the police show up at my apartment and people asking questions… but I am also not going to ask for MY medication BACK because then he will use it as “evidence” that I can’t “control myself without it.”

I am at a loss with how to go about this situation.",1743874248.0,,1743877938.0,False,True,N/A,,False,False,False,False,False,0.71,N/A

At first, I did not care much but after one year it’s became concerning as her grades were very low, and she wasn’t doing any efforts to improve. All I want for her is her success in her studies, and I kept encouraging her or telling her to drop her phone and work with me. During the first year, as she wasn’t working I was like - well, you will work next year and it’ll be okay - But now, she still doesn’t do any efforts, and I just feel like I’m in relationship with someone not willing to take risks and just enjoying getting her brain destroyed by the dopamine she gets from endless scrolling… 

But recently it has gotten worse, as we are coming close to the final exams (that are very selective) and as I’m getting more and more stressed, and working more and more, she just stays behind me doing shit on her phone and showing me the funny videos she find. When asking, she doesn’t even now what her classes are about ! 

When I tell her what I think, that’s it’s killing our relationship, she’s just like “too bad, never mind”, and doesn’t do anything.

She told me it was my fault if she didn’t study much, and that I needed to force her into studying. Thus, I set a time limit on her phone (3 hours of social networks a day, which I find very generous), and not later that one week after I set the limit after scolding her, she says that I’m not her dad and she doesn’t want the limit anymore.

Her reaction are very childish and she always sulk whenever I don’t go in her direction. When our relationship began, one year ago, I was sure that she was going to improve, knowing she was smart and had potential, and now just feel like she wasted everything by her laziness.

She says she is just like that lazy, and I respond that I too am lazy, but there is a time for everything, and sometimes studying is not an option

I don’t know what to do, as I love her very much, but I just feel that it’s killing our relationship: I don’t want to be in a relationship with a robot spending her life doing nothing and being a child ! I’m seriously considering the worse, even though I love her, simply because if she cannot control herself on her screen time, will she ever do anything with her life ? I want to be with a human, not a vegetable.

Me [21F] and my boyfriend [23M] have been dating for a little over a year. One of his female friends is getting married this summer, and we are planning on taking a trip to the wedding a few hours away, with me as his plus one. I have never met this girl before. I assumed that since I don’t know the girl, and my boyfriend invited me, that he would be covering the cost of the 1-night stay in the hotel room. After talking to him, he was assuming that I was going to split the cost with him.

My boyfriend has this female friend who is in the US. My boyfriend is going on a US trip with his family. And he planned to do a trip separately for 5,6 days with his female friend who is in the US. They probably will be together alone, exploring new places, sharing beds etc. 

My question is if i feel so possessive and find this so unnecessary while he is in a committed relationship with me. what I am feeling is normal ? Or Maybe it's fault on my side but I want somebody to tell their opinion about this situation. I trust my bf. But why do they have to do this trip together alone in the first place? Is this a normal situation or does it look big only to me. I trust my bf but them sharing a bed, experiencing each other's care feels so unnecessary to me.

Back when I was pregnant he kept getting Snapchat notifications from what he said was “spam adds” I knew it was bs but we had a talk, and he deleted it and life went on.

Flash forward about a year later we are now married with a 9m old. One day when driving around a telegram notification came up on the car. It just sparked something in me. I knew it wasn’t good I had a gut feeling about it.

So tonight when I went to turn the music down on his phone that was playing for our Bub I couldn’t help but have a look at his phone.

I went to telegram and it was all there messages going back almost 3yrs with different chicks from what looks like OF, ( at the start of our relationship I made him delete OF, when I found it by accident when looking at animals on a rescue site and I went to open a new tab).

I took photos on my phone so he can’t deny anything about not replying or anything like that.

I have no clue what to do. Besides this stuff we have had the most perfect and healthy relationship either of us have had.

What hurts more is we both have a history of being cheated on.

We have briefly spoken about it tonight as our bub woke up. In the morning he will delete his account and the app in front of me and has agreed to give me full access to his phone from now on. 

I want to make this work so badly, anyone dealt with anything like this before? 
I have told him that if anything like this happens again I will be getting a divorce ASAP no if ands or but about it.

tldr: i am worried that i want to blow up my relationship because i am generally unhappy with my life, and in the past, that's what i've done to try to fix things. it works for a bit, but not long term. my boyfriend is ready to make sacrifices and commitments i am not.

some background: i was recently diagnosed with autism. i have had intensive depressive episodes my entire life. i have been having a particularly rough time lately (my psychiatrist, therapist, and boyfriend all know this, i am ok!!). before this relationship, i have had one other intensive relationship that ended badly, but stretched on for quite a while afterwards. it ended because i was moving and i didnt trust him (never cheated, but definitely had a intense wandering eye). i have moved a lot (think multiple countries both as a kid and as an adult).

my \[26f\] boyfriend \[27m\] luke is wonderful. really, truly wonderful. he is the most loving partner i have ever had. i feel so comfortable with him, and i am always 100% honest with him (which is why this has been really tough for me). we have been together for two years, and functionally long-distance the whole time. by functionally long distance, i mean there have been short 1 to 2 month periods where we live in the same place. 

luke and i started seeing each other off a dating app over the summer when i was living in the same city as him, and made the decision to get together right before i left for a one-year program. we decided because both of us couldn't fathom seeing other people. it was tough, but we got through that year. i came back to the city we met in for a bit before moving to another city for a job. we visit each other frequently (every 1-2 months). luke mostly comes to see me (he has better pto and makes way more money), but i do also go to see him. when we are in the same place, we have a great time

when we got together, i was not looking for a relationship whatsoever. i am very ambitious and, as i said, like to move around a lot. i'm also still young and not ready to start making decisions on my career  or where i live based on someone else. luke made me reconsider being in a serious relationship. when i moved to my new city, i was, of course, upset we would be long distance again. since i moved, luke has been looking for a new job in the city i am in. i want him to live here, but i don't want him to move here just for me (if that makes sense). i dont want the pressure of him moving here just for me, but i also just cant see us continue being long-distance if he doesnt. contradictory, i know. we have talked a lot about this, and luke knows how i feel. i also still am transient right now - im a bit newer in my career than him, and would like to live overseas again. 

i am not excited to text him or talk on the phone. i love when we are together, but he has traits and habits i find frustrating. we don't argue, but do get frustrated with each other. i don't talk about him much in my day to day life, and it just feels at this point like we are living completely separate lives. i am a pretty intense person, and sometimes he is so laid back that it drives me crazy. he doesn't challenge me in the way i wish he did. but at the same time, my last relationship was totally on the other end of the spectrum, and we fought all the time. 

i worry that luke just wants me to be happy, and he will do what i want, like move here, just so we stay together. i love him. he is a wonderful partner. but i am not ready to make the sacrifices he is. i don't know if it is okay to let him do that, as long as i'm clear where i stand, or not. i know that leaving him will not make me happier. i am not interested in dating other people right now. part of me worries i feel this way just because i am generally unhappy and have a habit of cutting people off and moving. the other part of me worries that i am hurting him by not being honest. 

i really don't know what to do. please help.",1758501841.0,,False,False,True,N/A,,False,False,False,False,False,1.0,N/A

 TL:DR; insecurities prevent me from being honest and intimate with partner. Need help reframing my thinking around his masturbation habits. 

I '26F', (A-cup as relevant information for later) have been with '26M' for over 5 years. We have a healthy, passionate sex life... until I start thinking about his masturbation habits. I recognize that there are many factors at play here, including the fact that I do not wish to demonize self-exploration and self-pleasure. 

I am looking for constructive criticism and advice from emotionally intelligent men that have experienced long term love. 

My boyfriend is respectable with his habits, he doesn't like thirst content publicly or follow well known porn stars on instagram- and has actively spoke down on the men who support women's onlyfans. However, I saw he looked up leaked pics and a wave of disappointment overcame me. I mean, at least he's smart enough not to pay, but of course he hopes to benefit from those that do and then illegally dispense the content. 
I get that he's going to do it, and I am going to do it, and that it serves a different purpose than partner sex. 
I try my best to address double standards and can see that something like a vibrator could be compared as an instrument or vehicle like porn could be (Obviously he could get his own vibrator but that's on him lol). 
For me, it is more so the specific women he is looking up in order to get off. Your classic Sommer Ray or Corrina Kopf. 
I cannot relate to this as I'm sure like most women, we do not have a favorite NSFW model. 

My boyfriend reassures me that he loves my athletic frame including my A chest, but my brain cannot comprehend someone getting off to fake/enhanced breasts, and then saying all natural is best. Can someone break this down? 
I don't want to ask him to stop, I get it's normal and frequency is not an issue. I recognize it is mostly mental insecurity on my end, and I am looking for points to help reframe my thinking. 

I recognize there is no right or wrong way to masturbate, and at least it's not friends or people we know, but it sometimes feels like the less of two evils. 

Also if men or women would like to speak on ""gooner guilt"" or ""post-nut clarity"". I find that when I have approached this conversation in the past, men are aware that their objectification is bad or unhealthy, but continue the habit. 
At what point can these habits become an issue and actually hurt performance/intimacy? It's clear it is already an issue for me that I will continue to work out.

At the beginning when we weren't officially dating the sex was amazing and very frequent. Now it kinda stopped. It's not the first time where we didn't have sex for a longer period of time. But it is really starting to frustrate me.

I stopped initiating sex because he was always too tired from work or just not in the mood. He told me that it's because of his depression, that it's gotten worse and I get it, I really do. But sex for me is an important aspect in a relationship and while I'm trying to be supportive it is messing with my self esteem, my mood and doesn't make me feel connected to him anymore. 

A while ago I texted him after we had a small fight, apologizing and saying that I'm just easily frustrated at the moment because of the lack of sex. He justed texted me saying ""I understand that"" and nothing else. And I don't really know what to do.

I really love him, he's such a sweet, cute and thoughtful guy but I don't really know what to do. The lack of sex is really hurtful and I can feel myself pulling away from him. We did talk about it, I expressed my concerns that I think that he doesn't find me attractive anymore, which he said isn't true.

Any advice on what to do or what else I can do to make this less frustrating is deeply appreciated.

I’m a 35F with a 37M husband. We’ve been together nearly 17 years, married for 4. We have a 3-year-old son who has been recently diagnosed with Level 2 Autism. I was also recently diagnosed as Level 1 Autistic, which finally explained a lot of lifelong struggles — masking, burnout, emotional dysregulation, people-pleasing, and chronic self-abandonment.

Our marriage has been deteriorating for a long time, but since becoming parents, the cracks have deepened. I am the sole income earner and have been holding everything together — career, bills, parenting, renovations on a neglected home we’re trying to sell. My husband has been unemployed for over 2 years after a disability leave. He was cleared to return to work but hasn’t pursued employment or education since. He has however been working full time renovating our house which we plan to sell and we’re hoping to make some money on before the market cooled off. During this time He’s been emotionally volatile, resentful, and difficult to rely on.

We’ve been in couples therapy and I’ve been in individual therapy for years, but I feel increasingly hopeless. There’s been emotional manipulation, unpredictable behavior, and lots of blaming and ultimatums. 

Now he’s insisting on moving across the country — either to the east or west coast — for a fresh start. We previously lived on the west coast and he never wanted to leave but I initiated a move home, for family child support. Now, He wants me to either come with him or agree to a custody split where our son would spend 6 months at a time with each parent, regardless of province. I’ve said absolutely not — every developmental expert agrees this is harmful for young kids, especially young toddler children. He’s accused me of putting our son’s needs before his and says his health and freedom need to come first now.

Here’s where I’m feeling deeply conflicted, and I’d really value insight from women who’ve been through similar turning points:
	•	How do you know when you’ve truly done everything you can to save a marriage — and when it’s time to walk away for good?
	•	What helped you navigate the emotional and logistical challenges of separating when there’s a young child involved, especially one with special needs?
	•	For those who relocated after separation, how did you weigh the value of extended family support against better career opportunities and autism services in a new city — especially if you were starting over alone?

We have 2 teenager daughters (16 and 14), one of whom will be starting college in September.

Don't get me wrong, my husband is not a bad man, but I feel like he needs a rocket under him most days. We both work full time, but I take the lead with shopping, cleaning, laundry, organising home improvements/repairs and holidays. He hasn't booked or organised a single holiday, not even our honeymoon, in the 18 years we have been together. 

My husband earns a lot more than me. On a day to day basis, he pays the mortgage, utilities and anything to do with our car. I pay for everything else: clothes, food, toiletries, cleaning products, pet food, everything our girls need, DIY supplies, furniture, etc etc. There is a lot of everything else! My husband doesn't put his hand in his pocket to help me out, in fact he usually only spends his ""excess money"" on takeaway.

He has taken quite a few trips away with work over the years and I have stayed home and held things together. When he gets back there is never any gratitude unless I ask for it and he has never repaid the favour.

As well as holidays, he doesn't organise dates, family outings, meals, birthdays, Christmas or valentines. He has never surprised me once, except on my 40th birthday which was during covid. In the past I have organised surprises for him, I've even attempted to tick a few things off his bucket list. These days I'm less and less interested in doing this for him because of how little interest he shows in me or us as a couple.

It feels like ever since he got the ring on my finger, he decided he didn't need to try anymore. I know he loves me, but no matter how I try to get him to engage, he doesn't. I don't know if he can't or won't and I'm fed up of saying the same things over and over.

I feel like I’m overthinking but it’s also really bothering me. Idk if I should feel this way….

Sooo to start me and my husband have realised that over the years we are not very good planners for birthdays and holiday gifts to each other, that being said a couple years ago I told him we should plan better and makes sure we are looking ahead for things coming up. He agreed and we moved on….

I have to add, this has happened multiple times, where his family’s birthday comes and he’s planning to get a cake or a gift, WEEKS in advance. He plans what to get our dads for fathers day weeks in advance. He’s already asked me to make a cake for his mom and her bday is at the end of June. So that’s how it’s been, understand this, please.

The beginning of may comes and he asks me what we are going to get his niece for her college graduation, I tell him we will see and since we get paid at the end (or beginning of the month depending how you look at it) maybe we can do an IOU since she graduates at the end of may. He starts asking around what she wants. (In my head I’m saying waittttt HAHAHAH Mother’s Day is firsttt, we can talk about  it later! )

(I’m kinda just dreading already knowing what’s happening, he’s not thinking of Mother’s Day because by the time mother’s day comes we will be short on cash, and we were, we had no money on Mother’s Day.)

He does not stop, throughout the month he probably asks me 10 times what we are getting her. He finally said someone sent him a pair of shoes she wanted. I’m like ok cool, maybe we can get them when we get paid again, it’s ok if it’s late. Shel be happy.

Mother’s day comes

This past mother’s day, I did not receive anything, no card no gift…. And mother’s day being 11 days in, I was a little disappointied when no plans were made (when we did have money) no card was given. I know it doesn’t have to be a giant deal but I would like a tiny bit of something…

Me knowing the day of Mother’s Day we were tight with cash, I thought he might have planned ahead and saved money (I’d Hoped) to go out and at least have dinner. But no, I get over it and we just hang out. We visit our moms and that’s it. He says he’s sorry and I say it’s ok I understand.

The whole entire month of may he keeps asking me what we are going to get his niece for her college graduation. Her graduation was at the end of may.

Her graduation day comes and he has a big thing of balloons and some flowers. Honestly, my heart fell, as dramatic as that sounds. Yes, she deserves it. We are proud of her. Yes we love her. But geez, I didn’t even get a card!

I brush it off. Like how petty can I be. But then we get paid again, it’s mentioned I’m gonna get a gift or something I want. Nothing happens. I dont get anything.

We pay bills and do what we have to. A box comes in the mail and he says it’s his nieces shoes.

I’m like oh I didn’t realise you had gotten them.

We give them to her later that day and she’s fawning over them, they were Ivy city. He got them for a deal but still a lot.

In my head, I’m torn, I just wanted to be appreciated. I wanted him to at least get me a card or take me to dinner. Or plan something when we had money. In my head I just don’t understand why he does this to me. Over and over.

Other graduations are coming, we are still tight on cash. And he’s talking about what to get his nephew for his graduation this Thursday.

Tonight I asked him how much were the shoes, he said 60, I asked him how he got them cause I didn’t see them in the bank he said affirm!!!

My mind is blown.

He said since we have a beach trip ( I planned) this Saturday that he thought it was for Mother’s Day.

Nooo it wasn’t it was because we have been so busy with life. That’s what the Beach trip was for. Not so you can just ignore Mother’s Day.

She has a stressful work environment, experiences a lot of traditional pressure in her family, and she suffers from severe PMDD and some form of anxiety. We both work full time, have no kids, and I manage daily domestic tasks like the cleaning, dishes and laundry. Having to do more around the house during these times is no issue for me especially if it means my wife gets to relax.

Unfortunately I am starting to feel resentful and emotional burnout from her relying on me, partially because I have no time for myself to recover. She relies on me to maintain emotional steadiness as she is prone to panic attacks, and feels unloved if I am not able to anticipate her mood changes. Although I ask frequently, she doesn't feel cared for if: I ask directly about her needs and she has to spell things out for me, if I'm not completely attuned to her mood and the situation. E.g. I cook breakfast every morning but didn't include enough protein for a meal while on her period. Although I have it typically marked on my calendar, she has gotten upset that I wasn't considerate of her.

I understand that she needs a lot of care and to continue supporting her I feel I need time to recharge, but conflict breaks out when I state that I would like to work out, spend some time with friends, or add to my professional development. I want to make some headway writing my new book which would require at least 3-5 hours a week of research, reading, or writing. I also care a lot about my fitness so I would like to fit in workouts \~2 hours a week. Most of these things can be completed from my home office and home gym. If I could schedule the occasional coffee to see some of my friends, that would be incredible for my mental health.

Unfortunately, this starts a lot of fights with her as she feels like I am taking away our couple time.

*I am looking for advice navigating conversations about personal time but I don't even know if the conflict I am experiencing is normal -- How often do you fight with your spouse? What's a reasonable compromise for time that you make in your relationship to make this work? Is there anything I can do to help navigate this and not be emotionally burnt out?*

**Current Barriers:**

\- **Hostility towards conversation**: My wife becomes hostile at the suggestion of me having personal time. Most conversations are perceived as me wanting to be away from her which results in an argument, or her becoming anxious or disappointed in the relationship.

\- **My wife values spending time in parallel**. For instance, she would like to wake up together on our days off, but we have different wake times and I might be awake a few hours before she is. If I am on my phone when she wakes up this turns into an argument. I can't leave bed before she wakes or she feels like she is left behind. I value her comfort it is important to me for her to feel loved, but I feel like she doesn't value my time the same way.

\- **She doesn't like to have separate hobbies** so we end up doing what she prefers

\- **Arguments are exhausting, explosive and can last 2-6 hours of a day, and sometimes 2-3 times a week**. There are so many triggers to our fights that it's almost unavoidable. Our fights are best described as anxious-avoidant dances. My wife becomes more aggressive and I tend to lose focus and disengage despite my best efforts to stay present. This results in her doubling down and becoming more anxious, then sometimes turns into a panic attack. After the fights, my wife experiences emotional hangovers that she feels are my responsibility to help her recover from in the days to follow.

It's important that I don't do anything to remind her of previous arguments, but the pile of triggers is mounting, the fights seem cumulative, and I feel like I'm slowly burning out trying to manage or avoid those triggers.

**Current Considerations:**

\- I suspect my wife might have a form of anxiety that she might need more support than I can provide, but she doesn’t open up to her friends and comes from a background where mental health is not discussed with family or community.

\- I am in weekly therapy to help learn how better to talk to her better, as to trigger her sadness less and hopefully have these conversations from a more regulated space on my end.

\- My wife and I attend therapy monthly and separately and I have suggested going to couples therapy but we are not attending at this time and are discussing returning.

\- My wife needed a lot of support prior to being married, but these fights started happening around our engagement. I assumed it was just wedding planning pressure.

TLDR: My wife \[32F\] and I \[37M\] fight for hours and I feel like I don’t have enough time in my marriage to do things for myself, recover from emotional burnout, and even be present in the relationship.",1769200142.0,,False,False,True,N/A,,False,False,False,False,False,1.0,N/A

It’s a companionship relationship (not a physically intimate one by his design). He has a vacation place down south and I flew down to visit last week  he arrived a week before I did. He didn’t pick me up from the airport, told me to uber and to text him when I arrive at his building. One day during my stay he went downstairs for breakfast and a Pilates class. While he was gone I fainted and hit my head. I texted him what happened and he replied with “wow” and came up an hour later, after his class.

The next day we were driving in the highway and he was texting. The car was swerving, slowing down, speeding up, etc. I asked him 4 times to put his phone down and was ignored. So I took the phone and moved his hand to the steering wheel. He responded with “I’m going to do that to you the next time you’re driving”. I replied “I don’t text and drive”.

The night before I was flying home he told me that I have 2 choices for getting to the airport the next morning - I can uber or I can take his rental car and return it for him. No offer to drive me. I took an uber. I said good night and he said “so I guess I won’t be seeing you” - he didn’t wake up to say goodbye to me in the morning.

When he didn’t come up to the room when I was hurt, everything shifted for me. Everything he did started irritating me and I didn’t want to be around d him. I started seeing his behaviour and other little things that I didn’t pay much attention to were glaring at me.

He comes from an amazing family, although they have their issues they continue to be there for him and assist him whenever he needs them. Ive met them on a few different occasions and to put it bluntly, they are the family I wish I could've had from the start, they truly are wonderful people. He peacefully stayed close to home while in college.

Because his family was so supportive of him, he was able to go to school (uni) without much interruption, he didn't even have to worry about working, he was able to do what he needed to do without interruption.

He completed his bachelor's degree by 21 and although it took him a few years to find a good job, he now works a respectable job at a community college, its a nice comfortable office job with amazing benefits and pleasant coworkers.

I was reluctant to move in with him because I was in school where I was, but I had no support systems in place and I was drowning. I was going through it pretty badly and once my license got suspended for missing a court date, I snapped and came to a decision. I got my license reinstated and once I did I conceded, he had begged me to move in with him for the longest and I always said no, but I couldn't deny it anymore, I needed help.

Its not his fault and I dont blame him at all, but living with him is a constant reminder of where my life falls short and its been extremely painful for me knowing I could've been on his level, I could've had a good office job, I could've gotten my degree by now as well.....but thats not the life I was blessed with

My family was abusive and didn't help me with anything, they are the reason I left home for college, just to get away from that environment. It was quite clear that if i didn't work, I was gonna starve so I had to sacrifice what could've been precious studying time just to make some money to feed myself. The pandemic came and my campus shut down, me and several others had to go back home where I ended up leaving again a year later because of all the bs. 

A lot of crazy shit happened in my life that I didn't ask for and now im extremely behind in life compared to my boyfriend, im going back to school soon and by the time I graduate ill be 28 which is beyond embarrassing since most people graduate in their early 20s like my boyfriend. 

I know people get dealt different cards in life but did mines have to be so shitty? Did I really deserve this? Like I desperately wonder what I could've possibly done that was so wrong that I was deserving of such a horrendous life, so horrendous I'd be better off dead.

I regret moving in with him because he is a shining example of what im not, and tbh idk why he loves me when im not shit and wont be shit until I graduate.....late.

Then suddenly, the other day, she asked me out of the blue, ""Have you ever had a really good friend you wanted to sleep with?""

I’m going through something heavy with a close friend (that I consider like family) and could really use an outside perspective. I’m unsure whether putting distance between us is me abandoning someone I care about or protecting myself.

My friend (M33) and I (F27) have been very close for years. We’ve been there for each other in meaningful ways and supported each other through really tough times. I know he’s mentally struggling right now, and that makes this feel even more complicated. But some recent interactions have left me feeling emotionally unsafe and wondering if this friendship still exists or if it’s just draining me now.

In the last 6 months, things have changed drastically. He’s been going through what looks like a mental health episode, and is incredibly angry and resentful toward everyone and everything. He’s now in this phase of “I get to be angry” and “I get to take space,” which—sure, I respect in theory—but he’s almost proud of unleashing that anger on those around him.

We’ve had a few fights in that time, but they were literally about nothing. I've reached out twice to talk and both times he's insisted on doing this over text because he feels safer this way, which then the conversations both times ended with essay long lashing out. He’s been projecting things onto me, acting out, using really hurtful language, and being mean for no reason. He’s made false accusations and constantly blamed me for things that didn’t happen.

Now it's been a month and a couple of fights later and now he's said

***;“Would love to hang and build trust if that works for you and then speak in person.” “I have energy for you and our friendship but I don’t think I can sit with you right now and be like we need to unpack everything before we move forward.”***

I don’t know how I’m supposed to rebuild trust with someone who refuses to talk about what broke it.  And in the meantime, I’m the one sitting with a pit in my stomach, anxious about when he might lash out again. He hasn’t taken accountability for anything\*,\* not his tone, not his words, not the accusations.

My usual instinct would be to walk away. I can’t engage with someone who won’t agree on a basic version of reality or who uses their pain to justify harm/ can't take accountability. But this time it feels harder because I know this is part of a trauma response for him. He’s had a very difficult life, and I can see that this is all stemming from unprocessed stuff.

Still, it’s harming me. Emotionally, I feel depleted. I literally feel afraid of what he’ll say next, because it’s always unpredictable and very intense. I feel unsafe, and I don’t want to normalize that just because I know where it’s coming from. A part of me feels like I'm being a bad friend for still insisting on talking about this.

I [33F] have a good friend [27M] who is a good guy in many ways. But he has a (probably medical) problem with his bladder.

Some days it's fine and he doesn't need to go to the toilet more than a regular person. But sometimes, especially when stressed, he has a condition he calls ""stress-peeing"".

Example:
We wanted to go to a theatre play together. He REALLY wanted to go to this play, which in turn got him stressed.
He peed at home. We had to stop 3 times during a 45min carride for him to pee. When we reached the theatre, he had to go again. 
It's not a 3min pee break either. These breaks range from 10 minutes to 40 minutes.
We missed a big chunk of the show. We were lucky we were even allowed to still enter the place.
He missed even more of the show. He had to go AGAIN after we'd finally been seated.
I did not get mad at him because he was genuinly crushed he missed the whole thing.
I was a little bit annoyed because, if you know you have this type of problem, why didn't we leave an extra hour earlier? But again, I didn't not tell him because he was punished enough. All I did was swear to myself and all the gods to NEVER share a car with him again.

Fast forward to now.
I'm gonna share a car with him again.
Circumstances wouldn't prevent me this fate, unless I would tell him to his face how much his (probably legit medical) problem is a bother 😆
I'm sorry I just can't bring myself to be too harsh about it.

But I do kinda wanna offor solutions without sounding too belittling.
Like, should we leave an hour earlier? Has he tried those male incontinence pads (he told me he never had to full-out pee. It was just a few drops but he kept feeling the urge to really go).

At the same time, he’s been my financial provider. Supported me. Elevated parts of my life. Put me on game in ways I honestly felt only a man who truly loves you would do. That’s what makes this so complicated.

The cycle has always been:

betrayal → apology → good behavior → repeat.

Instead of finally walking away, I wrote actual terms.

He picks me up from work Friday. I stay all weekend. He drops me off Monday morning.

No ghosting. No gaslighting.

No vacations or “I love you” to other women.

Full transparency if other women are involved.

If he chooses another woman over our weekend, he pays $300.

He agreed.

And weirdly… I felt calm. Not hopeful. Not romantic. Just stable. Like there’s structure now instead of chaos. I’m tired of crashing out when I know I keep taking him back anyway.

But here’s the part I haven’t said out loud much.

In the beginning, when I first found out he was messing around, I fucked around with a doctor I was seeing. Not because I wanted him, but because I was hurt and mad. He convinced me he was done, that he wanted to be with me. So I cut everyone off. Gave him everything. Went all in.

And he started doing it again.

And I thought it was just one woman this whole time.

It wasn’t.

He’s still out there shopping.

I know this sounds transactional. I know people will say “just leave.” I’m being honest structure feels safer than cutting him off completely right now.

Has anyone tried putting rules around something like this? Did it ever actually work? Or does it just delay the inevitable?

We were together 1 year when we moved in together 6 months ago. He works a corporate job, makes 165k before tax.

I haven’t gotten a check since December and am waiting for 12k in invoices to clear.

We split pretty much all the bills and rent 50/50 except groceries, which we split 70/30. He does take me to dinner, pay for dates, stuff like that.

I don’t want to be a freeloader, before him I lived alone for 5 years, and have always paid for everything myself. But it doesn’t seem fair to split things 50/50 when he makes more than twice as much as me. Especially things like furniture, vacations and split all the costs (food, hotel, etc).

I brought this up to him, told him exactly what I made last year and my monthly average compared to his. He said if I am struggling financially then why did I buy new clothes last month (didn’t have winter boots, jeans that fit me), that he already pays more than me for groceries (which I eat less of and cook most of the time), and that he didn’t “charge” me when he spent $100 on household items the other day and that I paid more when we didn’t live together. I told him I felt like all of this was unfair and that if I was making more I’d have no problem splitting things 50/50. I said it seems insensitive to watch me live out of my savings while he has already made twice my income so far this year.

None of her friends know about me—only her parents do. We usually see each other once, maybe twice a week. For the past few months, I’ve been feeling stuck, and I’m afraid I already know what might be best for me.

I’ve tried to make things work, but it doesn’t seem to be improving. About five months into dating, she sent me an apartment listing. It was a very nice place and well priced, and she started pressuring me to buy it together. I was hesitant because I still had five years left on the mortgage for my own apartment. She became pushy and even rude, questioning why I bought a place (a dump) 20 minutes outside the capital city and saying that now we couldn’t afford something nice together.

This went on for about a week. I ran the numbers and eventually decided that buying together could be okay. In the end, the inspection revealed why the apartment was priced so well, and we didn’t go through with it. However, from that point on, we were actively searching for an apartment together.

After a few months, we found a place that felt perfect for us—and even for future kids, if we decided to have them. But when our offer was about to be accepted, she suddenly backed out. She said buying an apartment was too soon and that she wasn’t ready for her “worlds to meet.” I felt betrayed. Months of searching, many viewings, and when we finally had a great option, she pulled out.

She couldn’t understand why I needed time to process this or why I wanted to pause the apartment search. To this day, I don’t understand it either. We both agreed the apartment was exactly what we wanted. We didn’t buy it, but she still wanted to keep searching? She continued sending me listings for days even after I told her I didn’t want to. Eventually, she stopped.

Now, months later, I want to move the relationship forward again. I want to see her more, but her apartment is very small, and she’s strange about giving me keys. I recently sent her a listing I liked. She said it was nice but added that she now has too much stuff. It feels like she’s lost interest.

The apartment situation is just one major issue. There are others that bother me just as much, if not more. She is very self-oriented and often acts like she’s better than others.

For example, She ordered over $300 worth of clothes for her during an online sale. She decided to return most of them. Since she was busy, I offered to return them for her. She explained how it should be done, and I agreed. When I went to the store, they had just implemented a new self-return system for online orders. I figured it out and returned almost 40 items, took me over an hour.

Afterward, she checked everything in her app and noticed I forgot to scan one item worth $11—even though I physically returned it. I immediately offered to reimburse her, but she was furious. She said everyone is useless, that she has to do everything herself, and that we are all incompetent. I admit I made a mistake, but I was willing to fix it, and I was honestly proud I managed the rest on my first try with a new system.

She doesn’t talk like this only to me—she speaks this way to her mother too, which I find very disturbing. After returning from a vacation, she asked her mother to wash her clothes because she knew she’d be busy. Her mother agreed but said it might take a couple of days. My girlfriend was furious, saying again that she has to do everything herself and that everyone else is incompetent.

This is a repeating pattern. When I calmly tell her I don’t think this behavior is okay, she just doubles down.

She also constantly blames others. Society is wrong because she has to wake up early for work. She has a very busy schedule—working long hours, additional courses, and she insists on watching the news every night. If she misses a night, she uses time-shift to watch two to four days’ worth of news in one sitting, sometimes staying up until 4 a.m. on weekdays. She often sleeps only four hours a night and is exhausted all week.

Whenever I try to really talk about our relationship, I end up feeling like everything is my fault. If I say I want to spend more time together, she reminds me that she told me from the beginning she doesn’t have much time. That’s true, and I respected that—but my needs have changed.

If I say I might not be able to give her what she wants, she turns it around and says I shouldn’t say that because I don’t actually know what she wants. I want to move us forward, but I feel completely stuck.

We’ve talked about kids, and we both want them. She didn’t want kids in the past, but she says she wants them with me. Her apartment is too small for a newborn, and she would never move 30 minutes away to my place. I respect her wish not wanting to move from the capital. Given her age, if we want kids, we’d need to start moving forward soon.

But right now, I can’t even imagine buying her a ring. I don’t trust her. None of her friends know about me—only her parents—and I’m afraid in the future, that the same thing that happened with the apartment could happen again. We’ve talked about this, and she says it would be different, that she’d never change her mind or back out. But that’s exactly what she said before.

I love her very much, and most of the time things are good—when they’re good, they’re really good. But I can’t see a clear path forward anymore.

I’m looking for advice on how to approach this conversation in a healthy way and whether there’s a constructive path forward. How would you talk to a partner about feeling stuck and losing trust without it turning into defensiveness?

I’m considering suggesting a one-month break to gain clarity and see whether she’s willing to move forward, communicate openly, and put effort into addressing these issues. Is that a reasonable approach, and are there better alternatives I should consider?

TL;DR:

I’ve been with my girlfriend for over a year, but she hides me from her friends, sends mixed signals about moving forward, backed out of buying an apartment after months of pressure, and often treats me and others as incompetent. My needs have changed, I don’t trust her anymore, and I feel stuck. I love her.",1770741512.0,,False,False,True,N/A,,False,False,False,False,False,1.0,N/A

these are the things I have brought up:

\-his Instagram following 

\-old photos 

\-random and countless girls notifs on snap

\-talking about exs

\-flirtatious jokes with his male friends 

\- being able to talk to my friends 

\-being able to talk to his friends 

\-the ability to go out without being accused of cheating 

\-his extensive phone privacy compared to the access to my phone 

Now I have never been the type to go out of my way to snoop through someone's things. a partner a friends doesn't matter. I don't touch what's not mine. but over the past 2 or 3 months I can't get it out of my head that he's doing something behind my back. I don't know what and I'm not sure if I really want to know or just need to see with my own eyes. I have never been able to trust my own head. so I just did what I usually did and watched reels with him over his shoulder and eventually figured out his password. 

I've been kinda just checking the surface level stuff that bothers me the most. he keeps his notifications hidden so it needs to be unlocked to see what the notification actually is. and that's what I'd look at. figured out that most of the random girls on snap are posting ✨content✨ and he's added to multiple private stories. looking to see who's texting and saying what. if there's any kind of weird pattern I can find.

I got adventurous tonight and went through most I could stomach. he has old porno vids of him and someone he was obsessed with. doing all the things I want him to do with me without being asked or begged. and he seemed to REALLY enjoy it. more then he has ever enjoyed time with me. he has a reddit account 3 months old and the only thing he has looked at is porno communities. he has a dating profile on Facebook that was never taken down. he has TikTok collections of how he will ruin every relationship to get back with his obsession. and refuses to do anything about it. he has COUNTLESS OF girls on insta (he already done told me he thought ab being a porn star) he constantly accused me of cheating with his friends after I cut all of my friends off bc he thought I was cheating with them to or they would try to get with me. he gets mad at me for talking about my romantic past but will go on and on and on about his, good and bad. meanwhile I only really ever talk about the bad if it is brought into conversation. 

honestly I keep loosing my train of thought bc there's so much going through my head rn. I've been up for 2 and a half hours after a nightmare. I just wanna know wtf I'm supposed to do. I already know I haven't felt the same about him since the first week of us being together which in and of itself is an ENTIRE shit show.i just don't know how I'm supposed to handle this. confront him again? just let it go and ignore my head? leave all together?

I'm not a big reddit user, other than when I am wondering about other opinions on a specific situation. We are not living together so we usually call every day and play games or watch shows, and sometimes just chill and do our own things.

Recently, I have been busy with work (I work from home) and she has been busy with school work so we haven't spent much time with each other in person (just saw each other once in the last month, which was one week ago; usually we try for once a week but or once every two weeks if its busy), but we would still call everyday, until the past few days, where the work has overloaded us. I don't mind staying on call and doing our own thing but sometimes I would be really focused and I would listen with my earbuds instead of my headset since its more comfortable to work and we wouldn't really talk much. On two instances, she just says she's going to leave the call, which is fine.

She says she's feeling depressed recently, and has been raising her voice very often which makes it hard for me to comfort her. In these situations, I don't say much and try to listen, but that annoys her as well because I don't have anything useful to say. She has left the call after these situations probably like three times in the past week, and I just give her space.

There are times in our relationship where we haven't talked as much so sometimes I would check on her reddit posts/comments to see if anything is wrong. I don't do this regularly, probably looked at it about 4 times over the span of our relationship, and I usually just leave an upvote on her posts /comment secretly. I didn't mention that I snoop on her reddit occasionally other than the very first time. Recently, I checked because I felt like she was being distant and depressed so maybe I could find a bit more on how she was feeling if she didn't want to tell me everything. I saw she left some comments two days ago on an 18+ subreddits to explicit photos and was disgusted that she was leaving horny comments on their nudes.

I'm not sure if I should bring this up because I was technically snooping on her privacy. I feel like this is more than just watching porn, because it leaves a suggestive comment on someone's post for them to read. Should I confront her?

The problem is that my boyfriend will just straight up starve himself if I don't make him something too. Can't even put some ramen in the microwave for himself. 

That's where the guilt tripping starts. No matter how tired I am or what happened that day, if I don't make him a meal as well, he'll lie motionless face down and silent until I make him something.

I started a new job about four months ago. I am the director at this company and I have several staff members under me. One of them is a Muslim woman who is my second in charge. She is Arab, from Iraq, very traditional, and very serious about her religion.

At first, for strictly the first three weeks, I honestly did not think I wanted her as my number two. I felt like she was helping everyone except me and I could not stand her for a bit. But over time, I really warmed up to her and I think she warmed up to me too. We started talking more and our connection at work has gotten strong.

She is very strictly Muslim, dresses traditionally, has a big family, and is very connected to her faith. She is younger than me. I am 25 and she is 21, but she is extremely mature. Honestly, aside from myself, she is probably the most mature person in the entire workplace. I also want to make it clear that the program I direct would not be able to function the way it does without her. Together, we built the success of this program. It was not just me and it was not just her. We did it together, and through that teamwork, I feel like something deeper formed between us, whether that becomes something only inside work or possibly something outside of it. She means a lot to me because of that.

We do not talk much outside of work because I respect her religion and her boundaries. I do not want to interfere with anything she has going on and I am not fully familiar with all of her religious practices. But I really enjoy how we talk at work and I want to get to know her outside of that environment.

One of the biggest things is that we have a lot of similar interests that have nothing to do with work. We connect on personal things like movie references, pop culture, music, our ideas, and even how we think about clothes and fashion. Our chemistry comes from who we are as individuals, not from being coworkers.

The issue is figuring out the right approach because of her religion and her family.

When we talk it feels natural and effortless. The eye contact is strong and the chemistry feels real. Something inside me tells me she might want me to ask her out, but I am honestly not sure. I come from a religious family myself even though I do not practice anymore, so I genuinely respect people who take their faith seriously and she definitely does.

I have asked her small things about her religion because I am genuinely interested in learning. I have been trying to figure out my own religious path and Islam does interest me. Not because of her, but because I have already been exploring spirituality on my own. In a small way, our future practices could end up aligning, but that is not the main point here.

The real issue is that I want to ask her out, but I want to do it in the most respectful way possible without crossing any boundaries.

Another thing on my mind is that I do not want to overthink this and convince myself it is something more than a work dynamic. Sometimes two people have incredible chemistry at work but it does not translate outside the workplace, and I want to be realistic about that.

Another important part of this is about me leaving. Whenever I have mentioned that I am ready to move on or that I plan to find a new place at the beginning of next year, she has strongly expressed that she does not want me to leave. She has said things like please do not leave. When I said I felt like I had already made my impact here, she said you better not quit. She truly does not want me to go and she has made that clear every time the topic comes up.

Despite that, I plan to quit at the end of the year to pursue other things. I am good in my field and ready to move forward, but I really want to tell her how I feel before I leave. On one hand, I do not want to leave her in the hands of another terrible boss like the one she had before. On the other hand, I need to move forward professionally and it is hard to stay when I have feelings for her.

I am saying all of this because I am a non Muslim man considering approaching a Muslim woman who is deeply connected to her faith. I want to know how to handle everything with maximum respect and caution. I am not someone who dates casually unless I am intentionally in that mindset. I date with long term intentions and the thought of building a family. I want to make sure I approach everything correctly.

Any advice from Muslims, people who have dated Muslims, or anyone familiar with these situations would mean a lot. I just want to know how to approach this properly, respectfully, and without crossing any boundaries.",1765475939.0,,False,False,True,N/A,,False,False,False,False,False,0.9,N/A

So I, am starting to feel less and less close to my gf every single day. For context, she and I have been dating for about 2 years or so, and in the beginning she was the perfect girl for me. She was caring, listened to me, didn’t care about what bad things I had to say about myself and always gave me words of affirmation, and that’s not to say I took any of it for granted. I always appreciated her and wanted her to feel comfortable and happy with me as well. But as of lately, it’s feeling less like I’m with my girlfriend and more like I’m hanging around a weird best friend or even a close relative.
To make a long list short, she likes to act weird and she has a pessimistic view on just about everything. I like that she’s weird, it’s funny sometimes. I always said that I wanted my girlfriend to be just as weird as myself, but it gets to a point where I don’t want to banter and say gross things. I want to have a deeper conversation and just talk about things we could do together or just about how much we love each other. But anytime I try and steer into that sort of conversation, she always manages to do some weird voice of say something like “I’m gonna stretch you out.” I want someone who is perhaps a bit shy to talk about their feelings of affection or even someone who can day dream. Which brings me to my second point; she’s incredibly pessimistic. It’s gotten to a point where I see the world in a much clearer and empathetic lens because of how downright hateful she can be. I don’t like hearing about how she wants her parents dead or how she hopes a random two year old would get run over just because they’re a bit bratty. It kills the mood and honestly it makes me not even want to talk to her after that. And perhaps this a smaller thing that doesn’t really matter much but she is taking a point to let herself go. I know a woman’s body is her owns and I have no right in it as a man, but it’s just a little saddening seeing how she’s going from wanting to look her best to just not caring about her weight or her appearance and would rather just self shame about it. I try and steer her into a healthier lifestyle but her pessimism comes back with comments like “why would I go outside for vitamin D, I don’t want to get a tan.” Or “I’ll look stupid if I go out for a run or do home exercises.” I’m not saying I want to end things with her, I love her to the moon and back.

I know it was a breach of privacy and I felt like garbage as I was doing it. We have each other's phones passwords for context. I don't remember what feeling I had at the time that pushed me to do so. I found inappropriate messages between her and a FWB she had on the past. He does not live in our state but what I saw ruined me. I asked her pointed questions the following morning hoping she would just be honest and she wasn't. I admitted what I did and that I knew the truth. We fought and ended up giving each other space. Over a few weeks through talking and interacting we got through it.

Fast forward to the present. I want to say I'm being honest with myself in that I trust her. I have seen her phone light up with notifications and see his name and it triggers those memories. I never wanted to give her an ultimatum along the lines of cut him out of your life or we're done because I don't feel comfortable policing who she can and can't be friends with. I broke the other day and went through her phone again. I saw that she shared private videos we made together with him in a shared album. I was numb to it for a while. Unsure if I was trying to process it or bury it.

Yesterday I was at her apartment as I have been the past few days. I went to grab her phone to Google something because mine was in a different room and she slapped it out of my hand. Fast forward to us lying down to go to bed. She always sleeps on the side with the chargers. I lied down on that side because something wasn't sitting right just to see what she would do. She plugged it in initially then saw I wanted to sleep on that side and grabbed her phone and took it with her. I asked her to just give it to me and she wouldn't. She ends up falling asleep but I can't. I get up and move to the living room. She wakes up roughly an hour later and finds me out there. We moved back into the bedroom and I can't hold it in anymore. I explain I have nightmares about this person from time to time, which is true, and that the only thing I can think at this point that may ease my mind is to hear her say nothing is going on with them anymore etc. I didn't come forth with the truth because I want to believe she truly loves me like I feel she does. I wanted her to just tell me the truth. I wanted to just understand why. Neither of those happened. She said no so I followed up asking if I could go through her phone. She told me no and we had a back and forth where I still withheld what I knew and just continued to give her chances to be honest. Eventually I get up to get ready to leave, come back into the room and gather my things. She has the phone on her hand and is now ok with me looking at it but only from a specific out to now.

My question really just is. How can someone say they love another and just lie to their face. I know the truth would hurt just as much but only inso that they would also feel bad.

For context, my husband works midnights. He has nearly our entire relationship. He used to sleep from about 7-8 am until 3-3:30pm. However recently it’s been anywhere from 11am-1pm until about 6-7 pm. I don’t work due to an extreme amount of health issues. (I know this is a privilege to be able to stay home, but the pain is excruciating, trust me). But I still try to maintain a semi normal sleep schedule. Now because of my health issues, I need more sleep than most people. Like a lot of sleep. Now I usually get around 10 hours, which works wonderfully for my body. At one point my sleep schedule was amazing and I was waking up around the time he got home. However since we’ve moved, my sleep schedule has been a mess. I don’t fall asleep until at least 1-2am if not later. I’ve had to take medicine to get me to sleep the last week because I couldn’t naturally fall asleep. So I’ve been sleeping until like 11am.

This is where the problem is. My husband was upset that I wasn’t waking up in the morning for enough time to spend with him. I told him that maybe he should consider switching his schedule back to the original one, because we had way more time together in the evening than we do by the time I wake up and spend two hours with him (ish) and then he goes to bed. Mind you, I’ve been begging for him to do this for 6 months, at least. My sleep issue only became a real problem within the last month. He disagrees with this idea. I finally caved after he kept bringing up my sleeping in being an issue and told him he could wake me up. I thought this would be occasionally given how the conversation went. That may be on me. But him waking me up everyday way earlier than I need is taking havoc on my body. The flare up is terrible. I’m exhausted everyday all day, more than usual, and I’m starting to resent him for it. I’ve asked him if he could let me just sleep in 1 or 2 days. He laughed at me. Literally laughed. I just want to sleep a full nights sleep. Catch up on what my body needs. Multiple doctors have told me that getting enough sleep is key with my conditions. And I’m just not getting enough. I’m getting 8 hours on days I can sleep early enough, and only 6 when my body is hating me. It’s not enough for me.

I know I sound ridiculous. I know most people don’t get enough sleep. And I know I’m probably going to get some hate for this silly little issue. I’m sure I sound like an entitled princess. I’m not. I promise. I wouldn’t wish my illnesses on anyone. I just hope you can try to understand where I’m coming from. But I really don’t know how else to bring it up to him. I really just want a day or two to sleep normally. I’d prefer if he’d just switch his sleep schedule back to what it was. He was getting more sleep and we had more time together. But now I’m suffering from it and it’s driving me crazy. I just need advice on what other way to ask him to let me sleep in a little here and there. It’s not like I have a job to go to, I do almost all of the house work. Just let me sleep in a little bit.

I feel she barely cares about what I want. 
Dont get me wrong, she does make efforts sometimes. Like she'll cook for us at times or bring me a take away. But apart from that I feel she ignores things tht I truly care Abt in my life.
Currently I m an immigrant in a country, even she's one. I hv been taking care of our finances ever since we moved together, until she figures out a job for herself. Everytime I bring out the topic monthly finances, she gets mad & angry. Instead discussing things like adults she resorts to blaming me for everything wrong tht happening in our life. Even though I always make it clear tht I am not targeting her expenses especially. I jst like to discuss our finances & things we can improve on like adults, but no she likes to make fuss.
She says I don't give her enough time attention, even though I do try to give her most of my time tht I hv remaining after work. It feels like nothing makes her happy truly. All she cares about is whn is NXT dine out, or where can we go out together so see the places she likes. Even though I actively put effort to actively enjoy things she likes. But I don't see nothing from her side. Coming from low income family myself I know wht scarcity feels like, thts why I try to make sure she gets everything she likes, I like to spoil her in my own way. But I don't feel she ever appreciates it.
 Today we again hd a spat where she said I take 2 hrs to do do everything. Barely give her time. Even though I hv to do skip my imp tasks so she doesn't feel I ain't giving her time. Wht does giving time even mean. She think If I am home, I should be glued to the bed & sit NXT to her. I genuinely asked her once whts she like to do her in her free, she said sit in bed & scroll reels. I don't like doing tht all the time. I feel I should play games, hangout with my friends, hv couple of drinks with my other buddies. Everytime I go out with my friends we hv a spats. She has problem I don't give her time. I do give her time.e. Sometimes I feel she has some seperation anxiety of sorts. She grown up like with mom, she doesn't go dinning out alone, or even a movie, or anything. 
Honestly I don't know wht to do. I feel she the only person in the relationship. jst feel as more time passes we r growing more & more distant from each other. Is there a way to fix this?",1761974805.0,,False,False,True,N/A,,False,False,False,False,False,0.81,N/A

We are currently living together in my apartment, and we have always had a healthy relationship. We have had regular couple arguments, but we have always managed to talk things out. Within the last year, we made a plan to get a house then get married after. We began to send cute memes about marriage, jokingly calling each other husband and while, and even having wedding conversations about how we want our marriage to look, who would we invite, etc. He even told some people that I was his wife already. Due to some life changes, we decided to get married before getting a house. This happened around August.

The past 3 weeks I’ve noticed my BF has not really been himself. I could tell he was distant and something was on his mind. We had been getting into some dumb fights, but nothing serious enough to cause this. I asked him what was wrong, and he wouldn’t say anything. I kept blaming myself and asking him if I’ve been doing anything to upset him, and he only ever said that it’s him just thinking about his past, but no other context.

Three days ago I had enough of this, and after getting upset with him, he confessed that he is no longer certain about getting married. He says there is nothing that I have done wrong. He says growing up parents who had a rocky relationship that eventually ended up in a divorce and in general never seeing himself as a married person have been a real impact on him. But after dating me and knowing that I want to get married temporarily made him think marriage was worth it, which is why he was fine with it before. But recently he’s come to realize he’s not certain about where his true feelings are about marriage. I asked him if this had something to do with getting married before getting a house, but he says he’s not sure when it began. He says he still sees a future with me, and wants the same things as I do still but is not certain if he wants to get married. He asked me to give him some time to think about what he wants.

We haven’t really been talking since his confession. It has really hurt me, and has put me in a state of anxiety. I have been avoiding him throughout the day, as it is difficult to speak without crying and making him feel guilty.

Before he went to work today, we spoke about it sincerely for the first time. He wants to spend time with me and try to go back to normal, while he thinks about what he wants. But I don’t know if I can pretend to move past this while he thinks about it. I have told him this, and also something along the lines of me not willing to wait for him forever as it is unfair for me. It feels like he’s holding our relationship in his hands, and there’s nothing I can do about it. We did not get to really finish our conversation because he had to leave for work.

I know he’s not manipulating me or anything. He genuinely wants to take this into consideration because he loves me and doesn’t want to end the relationship with me. I’m truly not sure what my next steps should be. I don’t want to throw everything away, but I also don’t want to lose my self respect and stay with someone who isn’t sure if they want the same things as me. What do you think my next steps should be in this situation?

I’m sorry if this is too long, or confusing. Any advice would be appreciated. I have never posted on Reddit either, so if I did anything wrong I’m sorry! ",1761431062.0,,False,False,True,N/A,,False,False,False,False,False,1.0,N/A

I (27M) have been with my girlfriend (25F) for a while now. Lately, things have been rough between us — not because of any major fights or cheating, but because of emotional exhaustion and mismatched expectations.

She recently told me that she still wants to continue, but only if we can “fix our shortcomings.” I’m all for that, but sometimes it feels like I’m the one who has to keep proving my worth. I get comments from her like how she feels that she’s just “adding to my expenses,” or that she compares what I do to how people treated her in the past. That honestly hurts, because I’m doing my best to balance my career (I work as a doctor, so my schedule’s intense) and still make time for her.

I’ve apologized for being busy, for not always being able to go out or spend as much as I’d like, but I just wish she could understand that I’m trying. I told her that I’m satisfied with what she gives, even if it’s not always perfect — and I wish she could feel the same way about me.

We’ve reached the point where she said, “If it can’t be fixed, then maybe we should end it.” She says she still wants to work on things, but her tone lately feels half-hearted. I can’t tell if she’s still in this with me, or if she’s just staying out of convenience.

I guess my question is: how do you know when it’s still worth saving, and when you’re just forcing something that’s slowly slipping away?

This is a unique situation for me, in every relationship I've been in the guy has been the one to develop and voice those feelings first, it's never been me fighting not to say it every single dang time this man looks at me. 

He's everything I want and need in a partner, we have similar goals, morals, values, he shows up for me in the ways I need and loves that I do the same for him. He's said to me a few times that I ""have his heart"" and I can't help but wonder if that's his way of saying it without saying it but maybe I'm reading too much into it. 

I know some people will say this is just the honeymoon and I don't really ""know"" yet but honestly, as a person who's been in a few long term relationships and thought I was in love, this is real and it's slightly terrifying lol 

Anyways, I'm looking for advice on when you found the timing worked for you, what things you considered before saying it, ect. Tia 🩷",1759217244.0,,False,False,True,N/A,,False,False,False,False,False,1.0,N/A

We got married before i went on deployment and moved in together when i got back (6 months ago).

Since then, ive started to realize that we are  incompatible and im unhappy in the relationship. Most of our problems arise with sex and her being very codependent.

With sex, she views it as something that we MUST do every day or it will ruin her night and mine in the process. Some nights i just don’t have the energy or motivation to have sex. Those nights she touches on me and says things like “most men would never say no to their wife for sex” or “i can’t believe your saying no”. I have told her to stop making comments like that but she doesn’t seem to care. Here recently sex has started to feel like a chore and something i dont enjoy anymore. It’s gotten to the point where i’ll just zone out during it.

With her codependency, I am someone who wants to go out with my friends and enjoy hobbies (basketball, watching football) a couple times a week. Every time i mention that im going to do something like that it’s 50/50 chance that it’ll cause an argument. I also enjoy playing the game a couple hours every other day just to unwind and destress with my friends, this is 100% chance of an argument. She doesn’t seem to want me to do anything unless it’s with her and god forbid i go shit without inviting her to sit on the bed. She wants to do everything together and im just not that kind of person.

The third issue being that she is very nervous and anxious around other people. To the point where she won’t even call the doctors or anything of that nature. So this ends up with me handling ALL of the adult responsibilities and im just mentally exhausted from all of this.

The worst part is that i don’t think she knows at all how im feeling. I think shes really happy and thinks we’re gonna spend the rest of our lives together but i just don’t see that happening. Everything else for me is going great i just dread coming home. I feel awful for the whole thing and i don’t know what to do.

I realize we shouldve moved in together before i left but the military makes that kind of difficult and i had an impending deployment. I’m very stuck and confused on what to do. Any advice helps thank you!

TLDR: We married young and now that we’re living together full time i realize we’re not compatible and im unhappy. She is very happy and doesn’t see anything wrong with what she’s doing (even though ive told her) please help.",1758915670.0,,False,False,True,N/A,,False,False,False,False,False,0.89,N/A

Lately, my wife has been keeping her distance from my son. Her concern is that he’s being aggressive “for no valid reason,” and she gets easily annoyed by his behavior. From my side, I feel sorry for him. I believe his behavior comes from struggles he’s going through rather than him just being “bad.” It hurts me to see him treated with distance when what he probably needs is more patience and support.

At the same time, I understand my wife is under stress with the pregnancy and may not have the energy to deal with his difficult moments. I feel torn between supporting my son and making sure my wife feels comfortable as we prepare to welcome our newborn.

I’m looking for advice on how to:
	•	Support my son emotionally so he doesn’t feel pushed aside.
	•	Help my wife cope with his behavior without feeling resentful or distant.
	•	Balance the family dynamic so both kids (my son and the baby) will feel loved and secure.

We met in October 2024 and things moved fast because everything felt so right. By February 2025, we were living together. From the start, we connected on every level—emotional security, sexual compatibility, and just having fun together. I’ve never gotten along with someone this well before.

But since August 2025, I’ve noticed changes. Sex is less frequent and what we do has shifted. When I’ve tried to bring it up, she gets defensive. She says she didn’t realize anything was different and doesn’t know how to change it. She also told me she hates feeling pressured. I’ve tried to give her space, but now I feel scared to initiate at all because I don’t want her to feel uncomfortable.

What hurts is that intimacy used to be such a safe, fun space for us, and now it feels fragile. Sometimes I worry she only goes along with sex out of obligation, which makes me feel guilty. I still flirt and compliment her, but she seems guarded, like she’s afraid I’m trying to initiate. I even offered to stop having sex altogether to take the pressure off.

We still get along really well outside of this, but I feel like I can’t fully be myself with her anymore. I want to understand what’s happening and how to support her, but whenever I bring it up, it turns into a fight.

The past 5 years have been a little rough because he went back to school, and was unemployed, and I pretty much had to cover 80% of expenses. We never communicated that this would happen, so it took a big toll on me  and I broke down last year bc I was feeling stressed and overwhelmed. 

He is now graduated and has desperately been looking for a job. He feels really bad that I’ve had to cover a lot of our expenses, and promised that when he gets a job, he will be on top of paying for things again. He finally found a job but I think all these years of dealing with the financial situation has turned me off :(

Like I can’t remember that last time he took me on a date! It feel like my needs haven’t been met in a while! Idk if it’s also all the stress I went though, but I feel like it’s even affecting me with how attracted I am to him, yet I absolutely adore him to pieces. 

This person is my absolutely best friend. My twin flame, my everything, but I guess I’m just wondering if anyone has been in my shoes? Were you glad you waited?

During the entire process of my enlistment my boyfriend seemed super duper on board with the whole idea of me going as he knows this has been my plan since i was 15. Randomly the other day he i guess went down the rabbit hole of the sexual assault rates for women in the military and basically confronted me about it telling me that he “didn’t understand why i was choosing such a dangerous path” and basically told me that it was like i wasn’t valuing my life and safety by going. I understand that there are risks being a female in the military as there are risks being a girl anywhere and i’ve had multiple female friends join and be fine. I gave him my reasons for joining again (i promised my grandpa on his death bed that i would go- that’s not the only reason it’s just a big one as i was raised mostly by him during childhood) and he basically gave me the condition that he would drop the subject and be fine with it (to an extent of not tweaking about my safety every 5 seconds) if i promised to not be friends or interact with guys in the navy unless it’s like absolutely necessary. I then brought up scenarios where if it was like a female friends brother or something and he got agitated and stated freaking out in the car about how i was creating situations to break the promise to not befriend any guys. I am not one to cheat and he knows this, this entire situation is happening because he believes that all the men are going to hurt me while i’m in there and he’s made the point prior that since i will be away he “won’t be there to protect me” which i did not like because he was making it sound like i am fragile and cannot hold my own and need him to protect me at all times. I don’t think it’s fair to tell me i cannot befriend half the population solely off the guidance of “safety” (also for context ive always had a lot of male friends the friend group i met my boyfriend though is all dudes) i don’t know how to approach this situation because it feels like he is being controlling about all of this but i know it’s out of love and need for me to be safe i know myself and i know i will probably end up becoming friends with guys while im in there, i had originally been planning on just not telling him about any of them but then i realized if i did that it could come off as me “trying to cheat” or something or put strain on the relationship for lying about it.

285,2026/2/27,17: 8:59,1ml30mi,relationshipadvice,I [28M] learned my [39F] girlfriend lied about her age and her birthday is coming up.,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationshipadvice/comments/1ml30mi/i_28m_learned_my_39f_girlfriend_lied_about_her/,/r/relationshipadvice/comments/1ml30mi/i_28m_learned_my_39f_girlfriend_lied_about_her/,7,AggressiveMongo2162,6,"TL;DR: GF lied about her age when we started dating, now I know her true age and want to confront this issue with her properly before her birthday so that she can celebrate it and not feel bad about it, and not feel bad about lying to me about it because she lied for fear of me rejecting her due to the age difference.

When I met my girlfriend 2 years ago she told me she was 32 at the time, she can physically pass for being a few years younger than her actual age, and she is so joyful and energetic I didn’t think twice about it. Over time I started to know more about her life, now I know she kind of skipped 13 to 17-18 elyears old in her stories, she organized them in such a way it would make sense she was 32 and not 37 at the time (39 now, soon to be 40 ). Knowing her and going through A LOT of things in these 2 years, I understand that she lied to me because she was afraid I would reject her because of the age gap as I was the first man she had considered dating after being separated 6+ years at the time. I remember the first time she asked my age she said she though I was 32 or so (for some reason other people either over or underestimate my, almost no one gets it right) so I’m guessing she made it up on the spot and then kept maintaining the lie successfully, she didn’t deviate from years of events, had reasonable explanations for things, etc

A couple of months ago I had an indirect confirmation of her true age through a relative, but I didn't confront her about for a good reason (that would make the post longer to explain.

Now her birthday is coming up next week and I want to know what you guys think is the best way to “confront” the issue without her feeling bad about it. She deals low self-esteem at times, and even though my parents get along great with her (we are currently living with them) and have been very supportive and have never made the age difference a problem, she must feel as if she is too old for me and may feel embarrassed about lying. I’m constantly reassuring her of many things but she had a very tough past, though things have gotten better in that regard over time. I think this is one of the things that’s making it difficult for her to move over the fear of me leaving her and I want to do it in the most helpful way possible.

I plan sending a letter to her job with a courier a couple of days before her birthday prefacing how much I love her and that her age is not a problem for me at all, and that now knowing her age makes me appreciate her even more because despite her though life she is such a lively, joyous and amazing woman, always determined and always moving forward.

I know her and when she is upset she goes silent and wants to withdraw, and I know she can get very upset at herself, so I want her to be able to maybe read the letter right before she leaves work, the commute is very long so that she can have enough sort of alone time (as in a moment where she is not around anyone she knows, she can just sit on the bus and be with her own thoughts for a while) and process it before we meet at home, and then she can enjoy her birthday a few days later without that weight on her. My goal isn’t to avoid having to support her because I always have and will support her in a difficult moment, but I want her not to feel judged, and this is such an specific issue that if I do this in person no matter how tactfully I go about it she will feel judged.

I’m looking for advise here precisely because I have always found a way to deal with difficult issues with her, but this time I’m not sure.

I certainly screwed up an opportunity for her to open up to me about this; one time she came up with one of those, “would you still love me if I…” type scenarios, she asked if I would have liked her if she was 50 and I said “Only if you were super-hot for 50”and tried to laugh the question away as I sometimes do with that type of questions; that made her angry but only for a while. If I think she is hot, beautiful and amazing at “34” then in most men’s logic that is going to be even more so if she is actually more, shall we say “yeared”. I certainly don’t see her as old in any way shape or form.

PD: I didn’t explain the reason her age didn’t come up in her 2 previous birthdays because that would make the post even longer; it just didn’t happen.

PD2: I don’t want it to come across as if I know her better than she knows herself, but quite simply we’ve had some many things happen to us and so much struggle to stay together for such a short relationship that I know her enough to know what is going on in her head in this regard. We are deeply connected, to the extent that I don’t even try to hold off anything she may pickup I’m hiding anymore, other people think I’m hard to read but she just reads me like big print book.",1754677641.0,,False,False,True,N/A,,False,False,False,False,False,0.89,N/A

We've been together for 5 years. We had a conversation recently about me wanting to feel more chosen in our relationship. It feels as though a lot of the things that happened in our relationship is because I push things forward: I moved cities; I was the one who wanted to live together; After moving in, I was the one who wanted to consolidate finances (even though I earn more); even taking holidays. Safe to say I have the most initiative and he's more the 'go-with-the-flow' type of person. And when I do make the initiative, it's not always met with enthusiasm but a lot of doubts and negativity (i.e. not sure if moving in together is the right move, or taking a long trip to meet family for the first time).

It pressed on my nerves and had to be aspirated with a needle. Further trauma or overuse could cause it to return or even require surgery.

Our dog has epilepsy and pica. She’s bitten and scratched me multiple times, reinjuring my wrist. My husband (41M) and I had previously agreed I should avoid handling her while healing.

Suddenly, without warning, he told me he was leaving to fix his dad’s car and left me to give the dog her medication and care for her. He also insisted I keep her in the bedroom, the only room with working AC (our central air broke), to avoid seizures from overheating. I wasn’t physically or mentally prepared to care for her safely in there.

She got under the bed, started chewing (she’ll eat anything), and got her leash tangled. I had to coax her out while trying not to hurt myself. I ended up having to crate her for safety.

On top of all that, he didn’t even open the childproof pill bottle before leaving. When I told him how difficult that made things, he blamed me for not asking him to. I would have asked if I hadn't been so overwhelmed about needing to keep her in the bedroom.

What hurts is that instead of apologizing or acknowledging I was put in a hard situation, he said I was just lashing out because I’m in pain. Every time I try to express my feelings when he upsets me, he gets defensive and blames me. 

I’m worried how it will go if I end up needing surgery. I feel like my feelings are always dismissed. I just want my feelings acknowledge with a little empathy.

Why does he refuse to acknowledged it was a difficult situation?",1753547161.0,,False,False,True,N/A,,False,False,False,False,False,1.0,N/A

He behaves as though me not replying to each and every text hurts his feelings. 

It makes me feel like if I don't send at least an emoji as a response to each message then he will get upset. 

My neighbor also know I have a very high-stress and long hours day job. I hardly have time off. I actually JUST got diagnosed with HIGH-blood pressure due to all the stress I'm under due to WORK and FAMILY DRAMA.

I would ask a few things next time we plan to see each other.

1. Read the menu so you dont make a scene over something you choose not to try.  -- I ordered a french dip and didnt see it had horseradish sauce on it and asked to get a new one very kind and politely.
2. Please dont wear clothing that looks like you are a trump supporter just isnt classy. --- my shirt had a usa flag on the side under my arm and down the shirt it was partial but looked good.  shirt was new and clean with a collar.
3. Please make an effort on grooming better.  - she mentioned she could see a little hair on my ears like i should shave them or something..
4. From now on we will go to lower class and take out places because there is a certain etiquette that I'm used to and I think you are a little too rough around the collar for my selections. -- because i asked for a new sandwich

Dont take this too personal.

then it was followed by this.

Also, I'd rathere not come to you house with it being in disarray.  So when its clean to a reasonable standard i'd entertain the idea of coming by.  I kind of feel like all that we accomplished when we met has sort of reverted back.  we went shopping for nice clothes shoes ect. we remodeled your house ect but i just feel like things have changed so much its like none of those things ever happened.  Its very disappointing but its not my life and its not me so i cant really judge but i can decide how i want to proceed going forward.

\- I left her and she begged me to come back because she had not seen me in months and was boasting to me about this new platonic friend she met.  turns out when i broke it off she cultivated that into making vacation plans to meet this guy and insisted on the platonic thing until she admitted if she went the would have hooked up.

\- we had been back together for about a week before she just dropped these texts on me right before i go to bed.  we were talking about a tv show then she went silent and came back with the above which caused a massive fight which ended up in me leaving again and blocking her.  I am just so confused.

\-  my house is clean though it has no carpet in a few rooms currentlly as it is being replaced.

\-  my house is still nicely remodeled.  its been a year since it was done

\-  we went shopping once and got a pair of  jeans, a pull over sweater and some dressier shoes in 3.5 years.

\- its been over a year since she has been to my house.

\- during the fight she accused me of being a narcissist for trying to defend myself.  She has led me to read so much about narcissism in regards to her behavior over the last 3 years i just dont see how i could be one.  I am one of the kindest people i try to help and be a good person.  i dont insult and dogg people i dont bash their car house or be mean in general.

I'm so proud of him, and I do his hair and facial hair so he finally sees how goodlooking he has always been. I honestly couldn't care what weight he was at, I genuinely found him attractive both ways.

However, over the 3 years, I tried birth control and went off birth control after I had gained 40 lbs in 3 months from it. It totally ruined my body. I have some pretty bad anxiety and my medication makes it hard to lose weight, even though I'm always trying. I lost only 5 lbs even though I feel like I'm trying way harder to lose weight than he was. He went from 4 donuts a day to 1 or two, and still has 3 meals. I went from 3 meals and no donuts to small 2 meals. 

After a particularly low calorie week (500 cals a day) he noticed I had lost the 5 lbs, and I was wearing a nice outfit. He was all over me and kept complimenting me. Since then there has been no difference in my weight, and he isnt all over me. He has no drive for me anymore. I'm the only one that imitates anymore. When I was 120 lbs, I couldn't get him off me he was practically glued. 

I ask him all the time if it's because of my weight, and he says no. Ask him if he would find me attractive if I was smaller, and he dances around the question. Now I know 160 sounds big, but I'm really not, I'm just no longer small.

I'm not sure what to do anymore, I'm off my anxiety medication because of dropped insurance and I have never felt worse. How can I help him find me more attractive while I'm trying to lose weight?

She initially said she didn't have any plans to tell me, but also said that she told our son [11M] a couple of days before I discovered the affair that ""mommy loves another person, in addition to you and daddy"".

On the day I found out, she told me that she doesn't want to break it off with the AP and that she wanted to be with both of us. I told her that wasn't going to happen, so she said needed time to find an apartment before we told our son.

We have spoken/texted about the situation sporadically since then: Apparently, she has felt that we were more like friends than spouses for the past 3 years, despite us still being intimate regularly, holding hands and saying I love yous. And that she almost cheated on me back then, but decided against it, although she thought I wouldn't care as we were ""just friends now"".

Yesterday, when asked why she lied to me for 6 whole months, she said she didn't want to hurt me. That she wasn't sure she wanted to be with anyone anymore and that she needed some time alone. The thing is, I already told her that I would take her back if she was willing to work on our marriage, she is the love of my life. She needs time to think and she also doesn't know if she will be able to stay faithful. She says she doesn't deserve me, but I'm willing to put this behind us, if she is. Especially the thought of seeing my son for only 50% of the time is heartbreaking.

I don't know what to do. My best friend says I shouldn't sit around and wait for her to decide. My heart wants her back, but my head is questioning whether I can trust her again. 

I'm not sure what advice I'm looking for, maybe just some pointers on how to handle this?",1747333035.0,,False,False,True,N/A,,False,False,False,False,False,0.9,N/A

I’m 25 and my boyfriend is 27. We’ve been together for a little over a year, and while he’s incredibly loving, supportive, and genuinely makes me happy—I’ve always had this lingering doubt. It’s confusing, because he treats me so well and wants a future with me. He talks about wanting to marry me all the time.

I love his personality and have so much fun with him, but I’m not always very physically attracted to him. I wonder if that’s part of what’s holding me back. I also worry about his lack of drive—he’s not super ambitious, and I’m working really hard right now because I want to have a family someday and be financially ready. I can’t help but fear that I’d end up being the one expected to provide most or all of the income.

I want it to be him so badly, but there’s always been a quiet voice in me saying he’s not “the one.” And I don’t know if that’s anxiety, self-sabotage, or my intuition trying to protect me.

He has a good job with a good salary and so do I. I do make way more than him but that doesn’t bother me at all.

My issue is that even though his salary is good for our location, he seems to have very little financial literacy and has poor money management in the sense that he lives paycheck to paycheck and has no savings. The reason why I’m starting to worry about this is because it means we can’t share experiences I’d like us to have. For example, I like to go to nice restaurants but we can’t do that because he can’t afford it (and what I mean by that is he can’t afford paying for himself, since I don’t expect for him to pay for the both of us), we can’t travel to places I’d like for us to go together or we have to travel on low cost options because of his constraints, we can’t go out as much as we want, etc.

My issue is not so much that he’s struggling financially but that he has poor money management skills. His rent is way above his means and it’s not even a nice place, he goes out several times a week with his friends every week for drinks, restaurants, clubs (heck I’d be broke if I went out as much as he did and I make way more than him), he has no knowledge of how to optimize his taxes and shows no interest in learning, etc.

To be very clear: I have no expectation of him to pay for everything, I simply don’t hold that belief and I prefer to pay for myself (it’s just my personal philosophy). I just want us to be able to share the good stuff in life together.

For those of you who have been in a similar situation, do you think there is a way to work this out? If so, how? I want to be able to approach this in a tactful way, as I know it can be a touchy subject for anyone. He talks about his financial limitations often, and I don’t know why. Can this become a bigger problem down the line? Just looking to hear from people who went through this really or even if you didn’t what your thoughts are.

Me and my fiancé recently moved to Minnesota. We are currently staying at her grandparents house until we both save up enough to get our own apartment. 

I am disabled and actively cannot work, so i get SSI Disibility which brings in around 957 a month(which nowadays is not alot for monthly income, i know that). 

My fiancé's Grandmother does not like me because in her eyes i'm not good enough for my fiancé since i don't have a job. 

So her Grandma purposely singles me out of all family outings/get togethers, and actively talks badly about me.

My fiancé does not try to stand up for me at all when it comes to this, when i try to ask her to help me out alittle bit to explain that im doing everything i can to be enough, she gets defensive about how it shouldnt matter how her family feels, and that i should only be affected by how she feels.
 
My fiancé will occasionally make ""comments"" about my lack of income/ability to do things and when i get upset, she snaps at me saying i shouldnt take everything as a insult, and that i'm being dramatic.

So i guess my question is does anybody have advice on how i can handle this situation? Because i love my fiancé, i dont want this relationship to end, but i also don't know how to handle whats going on. So any and all advice would be very much appreciated!

301,2026/2/27,17: 8:59,1js7hh5,relationshipadvice,I [26F] feel emotionally alone with my boyfriend [27M] even though he’s caring and loyal,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationshipadvice/comments/1js7hh5/i_26f_feel_emotionally_alone_with_my_boyfriend/,/r/relationshipadvice/comments/1js7hh5/i_26f_feel_emotionally_alone_with_my_boyfriend/,7,anonymousee10,2,"Disclaimer: This is going to be a long post, and my thoughts are kind of all over the place, so bear with me. I really need some perspective, and I’d appreciate any advice or similar experiences you’re willing to share.

I’ve been in a LDR relationship since past two years. On the surface, everything seems good - he’s incredibly caring, always picks up my calls, replies right away, and is supportive when I’m feeling low. I’ve never had to question his presence in that way, which I know is rare and something to be grateful for.

But deeper down, there are things that have been bothering me. He’s not a romantic person. He doesn’t enjoy going out, isn’t into traveling, and he’s a complete workaholic. We’re in a long-distance relationship, and whenever I visit him, we mostly stay indoors because he’s always busy. He never initiates plans. He’s never said something like, “Let’s go here” or “Let’s do this.” Even when we go shopping, he gets tired quickly and just waits outside while I walk around alone.

He’s very focused on building a startup, and sometimes I feel like that’s the only thing that truly excites him. I often feel like I’m dating a ball of stress. Growing up in a home filled with constant fights, I used to dream of being with someone who’d bring joy and spontaneity into my life—someone I could do silly, fun things with. I don’t know what to feel anymore.

I look at people around me—how their partners surprise them with small gifts, record their candid moments, or plan cute dates—and I feel envious. He doesn’t mind spending money, but he never takes the initiative. I’ve never seen him join me when I’m shopping, or pick out something for me just because. It’s not about the money—it’s about the thought.

He lost his father when he was young and often talks about the financial trauma he went through. He says he watched his family suffer, and that’s why he’s so obsessed with making money now—he keeps saying he’ll relax later in life, maybe in his 30s. The thing is, he already earns really well and is way ahead of his peers career-wise. He’s doing great financially, but it still feels like he’s constantly operating in survival mode. I get that, I really do. But right now, it feels like there’s no joy in the relationship. I don’t even enjoy spending time with him anymore because he never seems happy himself.

Every time I’ve convinced him to go out, I’m met with, “Can we not go anywhere next week?” right after. He hates traffic, hates crowds—just wants to stay home and work. He says he loves me, but doesn’t know my favourite flowers, couldn’t pick clothes for me, and probably wouldn’t even have the time to. His response is always, “Just tell me and I’ll get it.”

He says he loves me, but sometimes it feels like he’s more in love with his goals than anything else. I feel emotionally unseen. I don’t know if this is just a rough patch, or if I’m expecting too much. He often asks why his caring and supportive nature isn’t enough for me. 
He says he has no issues with our relationship, which only makes me feel worse—like maybe I’m the problem for wanting more.

Has anyone been through something similar? How do I approach this?

TLDR: My boyfriend is kind and caring but  he is not romantic. He’s a workaholic, doesn’t plan anything, and rarely seems to enjoy time with me. I feel like I’m losing my spark, and I don’t know if I’m being unreasonable for wanting more.

Ok, I know what I’d like to do, what I want is advice or what I should do.

My sister in law lives at home with my in laws, she is on disability and does not work. She does basic house work and helps them with things like doctors appointments, managing prescriptions, etc.

She called us up the other day and said that she feels that since she “takes care of” her parents that she is entitled to compensation and that she wants my wife and her siblings to pay her $10-15 an hour to do this.

Might I add she also watches tv 5 hours a day, gets stoned 3-5 times a day and lives rent free with my in-laws- things I wouldn’t pay a professional for.

I want to tell her to *%#$ off and go no contact with her- but my wife wants to preserve this relationship with her sister.

How do I cope knowing that our relationship is picture perfect, but is still coming to an abrupt end?",https://www.reddit.com/r/relationshipadvice/comments/1re22gq/my_25m_3year_relationship_is_coming_to_an/,/r/relationshipadvice/comments/1re22gq/my_25m_3year_relationship_is_coming_to_an/,4,isoiledmyplantz,3,"For some context, when we got together, school was a major discussion point because we both decided that we'd never want to do long distance and knew that his program was going to be very long and demanding. He was accepted into a local pre-admissions program, and had always planned to finish his doctorate program here. That meant we got to live together, grow our relationship, and decide where to settle down once school was over. 

  
A few days ago, he sat me down and told me that a spot had opened up at within his dream program. This program is states apart, and conveniently, he has family there so he'd be able to live for free. On top of that, the program is $60k less than the program he's currently enrolled in, and it's higher ranking. Obviously, this is a no brainer for him considering it's significantly less debt, free housing, and a more reputable name tied to his doctorate. Unfortunately, this also means that there is an imminent end to our relationship, and it's closer than I ever expected. 

  
I feel blindsided because I was very thorough with understanding his schooling and plans related before becoming committed because I desperately wanted to avoid something like this. But here I am, writing this in tears because my person is most likely going to be leaving me in several short months. I also feel understanding of his perspective. This is his life, his future, and his education and I want him to be set up for success. I want him to be happy and financially comfortable and if this move means he achieves that, I can't be upset with his decision. 

Overall, I just don't know how to cope. Usually, relationships end because you grow apart, have a falling out, or something significant happens that causes the spark to die. It sucks, but at least there is an absolute end and a loss of connection. In this situation, none of that is true. I feel more in love with him every day, we laugh together, we spend so much time together, there's never any friction, yet it's still coming to an end and will be ripped away soon. I'll be stuck thinking about him all the time, dwelling on what could have been, and potentially being regretful that I ever exposed myself to this level of heartache. 

  
I'm here because I need help digesting this situation and I need help understanding how to let someone I love go, knowing they may never return to me. It's not fair for either of us to wait these next four years out in hopes that we reunite. It's also not fair for me to be stuck on him indefinitely since there wasn't a clear ""end"" to our relationship. 

How does one cope in this situation when everything is perfect, but is coming to a definite and abrupt end? 

  
**TLDR**: My boyfriend is transferring to a different doctorate program, resulting in our relationship coming to an end, despite early conversations in our relationship that determined this would never happen.

It’s really disheartening to know that during his week off he didn’t even want to spend some time with me. I think it’s ok to be fighting and still trying to connect with other person in the relationship.

I know he’s had a lot going on in his personal life but im having a hard time not taking this personally.",1770709642.0,,False,False,True,N/A,,False,False,False,False,False,1.0,N/A

I'm really needing some advice and non-biased guidance. Very long story short, my now husband is continuing to talk to the women that I set firm boundaries about.

Back story: I found out about this ""relationship"" after I was 4 months PP. My husband started college later in life, and started to form a friendship with a women he met there. When they first started talking with each other, we weren't married or pregnant yet. Some of the messages included things like asking for her Instagram, offering a shoulder to cry on and due to the stress of the school work, and a couple late night phone calls.

When he was getting ready to propose, he told her about this and invited her out to a gym to catch up. She responded that ""have you seen me! I would be so out of breath"" and he said ""I'm about to be a married man so I can't say to much anymore, but it's always looked like you worked out""

I say all of that to say that is the type of foundation that was laid by him. He graduated in May 2024, so further communication wasn’t needed. So when I first found out about in March of 2024, I was very angry and he said she is just a friend. We had a very long fight and lots of disagreements, but he decided he would only communicate with her about school things (they were in a required group together)

To avoid an even longer post, long story short he has been in communication with her about 4 other times that I found out. They haven't met up and there was never anything physical, but he did decided to messages back and forth with her a few times. After the 4th time, I genuinely believed he didn't care about her enough to continue to make me upset or ruin our marriage. Well fast forward to a couple of months ago, I looked at his phone and noticed he had her unblocked still. I asked him about this and he said that he didn't do this, his phone email updated and that's how she got unblocked (I now know that this was a lie, shocker)

Now, a couple of days ago I went into his recently deleted messages, and noticed that their conversations was in there. I recovered them, but most of them were fully deleted and only a few recovered. The first message was of her saying ""thank youuuuu"". Whatever he said prior was deleted. After that, she sent a merry Christmas gif and he responded giving a couple of life updates and also saying if he could take her out to get coffee or food and said ""I miss you nerd""

Now, after writing this out I know how it all sounds, trust me. But I feel caught in those loop and I can't think clearly. He says it was never physical. He said she was just a friend and saw her as a little sister. He says how crazy I am to want divorce over text messages.

We have a child together, a house, building a life. He's otherwise a loving and caring husband. But this is the 5th time I've felt betrayed, even if it wasn't physical. He Will say sorry, but then follow it up with a reason as to why instead of taking accountability.

I really just need some advice, please.

Thank you if you have read all of this, sorry for the length.",1769893081.0,,1769893397.0,False,True,N/A,,False,False,False,False,False,1.0,N/A

Apologies for the lengthy message; I’m feeling quite overwhelmed and unsure of how to proceed. I appreciate any advice you might have.

My fiancé (29M) and I have been together for nearly a decade. We’ve faced challenges, but we’ve always managed to overcome them. I’ve even lost some friends due to disagreements about our relationship.

In recent years, things have been particularly difficult. He has been unfaithful on Tinder and spent our savings on stocks. He claimed the Tinder incident happened because we argued for six months about his career choice. Despite this, I forgave him, and we moved forward. It may seem foolish, but we have a long history together, and he has been supportive both financially and emotionally, especially when I decided to leave graduate school to pursue a different path. Now, I work remotely and only visit the office 2-3 times a month if necessary, and he always wakes up early to drive me there without complaint.

After that period, our relationship seemed to strengthen. However, in the past few months, he began spending our money on a game. Initially, he spent around $600 over three months. I asked him to stop, as it upset me because we are saving for a wedding. I spoke to him about it 3-4 times, and he promised not to do it again. Recently, just a month after the previous incident, I found out he spent nearly $900 on the same game in one week. He claimed it was for a rare event.

I told him this was the last straw and that I couldn’t continue the relationship, as his actions were disrespectful. He apologized and promised not to repeat it. I confronted him yesterday, and last night, I told him I didn’t want to talk, so he left me alone. I’ve sent him lengthy texts explaining how his actions hurt me, but his only response is an apology and a promise not to do it again.

I’ve suggested he seek professional help for his spending habits, but he only mentions it when I bring it up.

I’m at a loss because our wedding is in a few months. I don’t want to cancel everything after all the time and memories we’ve shared, but I’m unsure if there’s anything else I can do.

Thank you for listening. ",1769032307.0,,False,False,True,N/A,,False,False,False,False,False,0.88,N/A

There was always one girl \[unknown age but around ours\] was constantly texting my husband. At first the messages from her were borderline crossing lines but my husband explain she was a friend that he had before me and he’d like to continue with their friendship as long as I was OK with it. I didn’t want to be the crazy jealous girlfriend so I told him it was fine. That is, until she started asking him personal questions about me and asking him to go out on a date for drinks. I told him I was uncomfortable and wanted it to end and he agreed to tell her stop contacting him and he blocked her. I always felt in my gut that something was off and that they’d been a couple or something more than friends before me but my husband would tell me I’m just being crazy and letting my mind get to me. Throughout the years the situation has been brought up when our mutual friends are around and he continued to say how crazy I was being for thinking they were anything more than friends just by reading the texts.. flash forward to yesterday. We were talking about a mutual person funeral and I told him I never ended up going. Well this is when he slipped and said he was there and with that same girl AND they had been talking/dating at the time. I stopped him dead in his tracks because what the actual f. That’s when I said “so you’ve been lying for 6 years, making me think I’m crazy and stupid to our friends about that entire situation?” And he just said “I completely forgot about it, I wasn’t trying to hide it from you”. We’ve been open and honest about literally everything, or so I thought. Afterwards I was upset and pissed at him. But now he’s treating me like I’m even more crazy for letting that get me “so upset” and not accepting his half ass apology and moving on….. I still trust him but I’m hurt. I feel like I have every right to be upset, hurt, pissed. He even asked “when are you going to stop being a b\*\*\*\*?” And that REALLY set me off because I was literally just sitting there watching tv but to him, I was giving him the “cold shoulder”. I want to move past this but it’s still upsetting to me.",1768997003.0,,False,False,True,N/A,,False,False,False,False,False,0.8,N/A

He has always been further in his faith than I have but I do also go to church and always try to do the right thing. Within the last year or so I have noticed that he is becoming much more rigid in his faith. For example, I was telling him about a pretty disturbing book I was reading that was recommended to me and he states “that sounds really sinful” I asked if I am now suddenly supposed to consume only Christian material and he said that’s the direction he wants to lead this family in. He believes that everything we do should be in Gods name and we should be always speaking the word of God to others. This shocked me a little. I don’t want a life like that, and I expressed that to him. He was upset by this and said I should never put him in a position to choose me or God because I will never win.

He has expressed that he is afraid of hell and will do whatever the Bible tells him to do so he can make it to heaven. I think it’s important to note that he was a heroin addict for several years but has been clean for over 10 years now. He struggles very much with alcohol, he drinks every night and is addicted to cigarettes. He has never been married but has 2 children with 2 different women. I have been married and divorced a few years ago with one son from that marriage.

About a year ago he started reading the Bible daily. At this point he read that it is a sin to marry a woman who is divorced. Normally he was very loving to me and always wanted to spend time with me but on that day he got very upset with me and he left. He was cold and dry the rest of the weekend before eventually telling me that he was sinning by being with me. He spoke to our pastor who advised him that it would be ok to continue seeing me and even marrying me as this is what God would want.

The last couple of months I have felt him pulling away. Not being as loving, not complimenting me as much, much less sex, etc.. I kept bringing this up and he just explained that his testosterone was low and lowering his sex drive. A few weeks ago he called me and said he’s been struggling with massive guilt about premarital sex and that we should get married right away. I’m in no rush to get married and expressed how hurt I was by his lack of consideration of my feelings by basically asking me to marry him over the phone to relieve his guilt about having sex with me. Since then he has decided that we won’t be having sex until we are married.

I’m devastated. I met someone that I felt was fundamentally the same as me and suddenly I feel like the rug has been pulled out from under me. The sudden religious beliefs are concerning and I just don’t see how we can work past this. I just want to live my life carefree and love the people who love me. I don’t want to live by strict religious rules in fear of hell. I want to treat people how the bible says we should and I want to stay being a good person with good morals. I just don’t think premarital sex means I’m a bad person.

Is there any way to work through this kind of difference?",1768933793.0,,False,False,True,N/A,,False,False,False,False,False,0.73,N/A

I am a recent graduate and was about to accept a lower paying job (in a field I dont see myself in long-term) in the city I’m currently in but recently I received a call being offered job in the field I would like to be in…. In a city several hours away.

I started dating this guy and he’s treated me better than anyone I’ve been with. We’ve known each other for a year+ but just dating for about 3 months. From his personality, values, humor, and intimacy- I saw something real developing with him.

Ever since the call I’ve been crying because I don’t want to leave him but if I wasn’t with him I would accept the second job in a heartbeat. He’s such a caring person that I know he would be upset if I didn’t prioritize myself and choose my career. But he’s also very realistic and practical and I don’t think he would want to do long distance. He made it clear previously that he is not interested in moving. I haven’t said anything yet to him.

I would be open to moving back after a few years in the new city with this job, but that’s a lot to hang onto in a relationship so new. I already started planning my year with the first job- it would be lower paying but not challenging so I was ready to focus my time on life fulfillment outside of work. The second job would require longer hours and the distance would make it difficult even if it was something he was willing to do. I feel lost. I thought I’d have more time to build something with him.

There are lots of lovely hikes there, and that’s all he wants to do. He wants to do 30 miles in 3 days off of almost no sleep. He also wants to camp two nights to do this. 

I (23 nb) have ehlers-danlos and POTS, and quite a few places where I have tendon damage. I can go on hikes, but too much elevation and too much distance hurts and often makes me pass out. 

This is obviously frustrating for me, because I’d love to see all these pretty places. But he’s quite accustomed to difficult hiking and backpacking and the repetitive movement can go from healthy to unhealthy quite quickly for me. I was prepared for one long hike and one night camping on this trip, but he kept adding more. He also wants to add more hikes beyond this initial plan. But being in the middle of nowhere and injuring myself/ passing out seems terrifying to me. 

Every time I bring up the fact I think I need to space the hikes out more or plan shorter/ easier activities, he kinda laughs it off and shuts me down. It’s getting really irritating. I’ve also suggested we stay in town for a couple days and find some climbing gyms /museums (this is much easier on my body and we both enjoy these things) but he laughs this off a bit too. 

 Writing this out he sounds like a real jerk to me. But maybe I’m being dramatic and I can just opt out if it’s too much and stay alone in the car in another state for hours while he hikes. 

This is clearly stressing me out and I’m not sure how to approach the situation. I’m also on the spectrum and have a difficult time communicating when I’m distressed/ sounding serious. I think if he wanted to do all this difficult hiking, he shouldn’t have invited me. 

Any wisdom here would be appreciated. I’m at a loss on how to communicate to him that this is genuinely dangerous because he doesn’t believe it is. He thinks he can handle any situation, and I think that’s not the issue. ",1767689685.0,,False,False,True,N/A,,False,False,False,False,False,0.89,N/A

Also... I’m using a throwaway account because I’m concerned he might come across this post and recognize the situation

I’m a 30-year-old man from Brazil. Yesterday I discovered my debit/credit card was blocked when I tried to pay at a restaurant using Apple Wallet. When I opened my digital bank app, I saw several unusual transactions that had happened during the previous night.

Here’s what happened:

Around 1:20 AM (Dec 17), money was moved from my savings account to my checking account. Shortly after:

* At \~1:28 AM, there was an attempted payment using my Apple Wallet virtual card to a domain called JIM dot COM..This transaction was flagged as suspicious and declined.
* Then there was an attempted PIX transfer (Brazil’s instant bank transfer system) for a high amount, which was also declined.
* Immediately after, there was a PIX transfer that *was* approved, in the amount of R$3,000.

All of these transactions listed my boyfriend (28M) as the recipient.

Around 2:00 AM, my account received two PIX transfers back: one for R$1,000 and another for R$2,000, totaling the same R$3,000. What stood out to me is that this did not appear as a reversal or chargeback. It looked like two normal transfers from my boyfriend’s bank account back to mine.

Context:

* We’ve been living together for about 6 months
* He was the only other person at home that night
* When I confronted him, he denied everything, said he slept all night, and said he would never do something like this

I contacted my bank immediately, changed all passwords, reset security settings, ran antivirus scans, etc.

The bank provided more details:

* The transactions were made from my city
* They were performed on an iPhone, same model as mine

I then checked my iPhone battery activity logs, and there *was* screen activity for almost 30 minutes between 1 and 2 AM, with my bank app being the main app used, plus Apple Wallet.

I asked my boyfriend to check his battery activity as well. His phone also shows screen activity during that same time window, with his bank app as the main app used, plus an entry labeled “deleted app.”

I researched JIM dot COM, it appears to be related to an app that turns a phone into a card payment terminal. When I checked my boyfriend’s App Store history, that app shows up as having been downloaded in the past. He says he downloaded it months ago to sell some clothes.

Because I reported the transactions as unauthorized and they pointed to his account, his bank account is now temporarily blocked due to suspected fraud. He’s very angry about this and says I ruined things by reporting it.

Right now I feel completely lost. I’ve gathered a lot of circumstantial evidence, but nothing that definitively proves intent or guilt. I genuinely want to understand if there is a realistic scenario where a third party could have done this, and my boyfriend is also a victim — or if I’m being naive.

We haven’t had a proper conversation yet. I worked overnight, he worked during the day. I don’t feel emotionally safe going home right now, so I’m staying at a friend’s place while I try to think clearly.

I’m not here to accuse — I’m here because I don’t know how to interpret this, what questions I should be asking, or how to move forward without either panicking or ignoring serious red flags.  
I have screenshots documenting all of this, including the transactions, the bank’s responses, and both my and his phone battery activity.

Any perspective is appreciated.

Ps. I’m not asking for financial or legal advice. The bank investigation is ongoing. I’m specifically asking for relationship advice on how to interpret this situation and how to approach my partner.",1766162506.0,,False,False,True,N/A,,False,False,False,False,False,0.86,N/A

I \[20M\] am worried about my relationship with my fiance \[21M\]. We've been having a lot of problems over the last year or so. For reference, it's 4 years this December. Engaged for 2. As time goes on, I feel less and less compatible with him. We have opposite interests, opposite love languages, opposite libidos, differing emotional maturity. My needs aren't being met, while he expects me to meet all of his. ​​

We had a couple difficult conversations about this a few months ago. It essentially boiled down to ""here's what I need you to fix, you get 6 months to make meaningful change."" Well, here we are about 6 months later. Instead of there being a deep and meaningful change, we're just falling back into the same patterns.

I really don't know how long I'm willing to wait for him to figure himself out. ​I know how badly and deeply I love him. I know how badly and deeply he loves me. I just don't know if that's enough anymore.

The more difficult part that comes is how intertwined our lives are. We live together, go to the same college, work at the same job. We have 5 cats together, his dad does work on my car, he does my weekly injection (I have a severe fear of needles), when we do match libidos it's incredible.

Emotionally we're on different planes of existence. I've been in therapy for almost a decade. He's never been, never plans on going. I have this heightened emotional intelligence that he lacks. When I told him to work on that, he turned it from hearing me to only thinking about his own feelings. It's like there's never any middle ground. It's all or nothing.

I know this is jumbled, but I seriously don't know what to do. I feel like I need a break from our relationship, but I also can't imagine my life without him. I don't know what being alone looks like anymore. We've been through so much together.

She talked about getting some other piercings and I was supportive about that. But recently she said that she wants to get a lip piercing. I'm really not a fan of this idea for a couple of reasons. 

Firstly, and most importantly, I have eczema on my mouth. It's pretty controllable, doesn't flare up often, but I have to always be careful about my lips and what/how I eat. Sometimes when it flares up we have short periods when I can't kiss her at all, as it's painful. I'm afraid that if she gets the lip piercing it will irritate my eczema and I won't be able to kiss her at all without my lips acting out.

I also have other concerns, like I'm pretty sure I will hate the sensory feeling and the taste (I assume metallic taste is present)

I don't think that my girlfriend will risk my health, but she's very into piercings/tattoos and expressing herself. For example, while I would be perfectly fine to not dye my hair a certain colour if she said she wouldn't like it, I know that she would feel restrained and upset.

He says ""all men f*ck up"" and that ""I have no intentions to ever hurt you or cheat on you, but I'm a man and for me to say it would never happen could potentially be me lying and I don't want to lie"". In my mind, I view this as him saying  he will cheat, it's just a matter of when. He says it doesn't mean that but that he just wants to ""have a grown conversation and lay it out there for if ever we're to occur""

We have conversations with older people in his family and his aunt has said the same thing ""men will be men, it will probably happen but as long as he makes you happy and comes home to you then does it really matter"". And last night we went out with an old friend of his and his fiancé, and the fiancé also made a comment of ""men will be men"". My parents have been married for 30+ years and to my knowledge my dad has never cheated, but I also understand that parents keep certain things to themselves regarding relationship issues.

So my question is, do all men at some point in their long-term relationship cheat?

So I [33F] have recently gave birth to our first child. With my husband[36M] (together for 7 years, married for 1), we made an agreement before my baby’s birth that in the first days of postpartum my mother [70F] would be staying with us to help around and to ensure I and we manage everything related to the baby well, and give us a sure start to parenting.

 First day postpartum went well. However on the second day there were couple big arguments between me and my partner:
- in short his brother came over, and when my partner went to the station to pick him up I told him to not to come upstairs as I still needed to take a shower and would not be ready. And indeed I managed to get to shower when they returned, and my mom was watching the baby while I showered. When I was getting ready my partner was angrily demanding and yelling withe and my mother to greet his brother or at least give an time estimate when we would come down from upstairs - here I fought back, and had a short argument
- in late afternoon the baby did not want to settle despite I tried everything, and my mom made a comment that maybe the baby is overstimulated by the too much new people (this was a silly comment from my mom IMO, as only the brother and a midwife were at ours). My partner took this sentence too personally, called my mother a manipulative jerk, yelled at her and told my mom to go home and here I no as I needed her help. This later escalated to a fight between me and my partner as he felt that I didn’t stood by his side, and he did not felt our home like our home. 

On the third day evening we all agreed to give the baby a bath (obviously carefully because of the umbilical cord) and during execution it looked like my mom was explaining to me what to do, I was doing it and my husband due to space limitations he was not really present. This would have been fine but my partner was focusing on minor things (such as why there is a towel, while drinking  beer) and because him and my mother both are similar characters , both are very talkative and them both tend to interrupt one’s sentences with their own, there were multiple times that they talked at the same time. But when we were about to finish with bathing the baby, while my mom was telling me about the next step and she took a bit longer break in her speech, my partner asked about a deep frozen meal placed to thaw if we are gonna cook it or should we place into the fridge. Here I told him off for interrupting my mum’s speech and the food I understood it is time sensitive but it could have waited a few more minutes while I am not handling the baby. Well this escalated later into a lengthy fight, where he wanted to go to a hotel, because he doesn’t feel our home like our home until my mom is there and since I don’t want her to leave, he would and returns when she’d leave 3 days later. Here I told him not to leave as I needed and wanted him as well beside me. 

So the question is if he would have left, who would have been in the bigger shame? He say that I would be along with my mother, and his parents also think the same. I asked my two best friends and they both think along with me that he would have been in the bigger shame. 

So what do you think?

I [38F] have been with my partner [41M]  for 9 years. When we started our relationship, I had quite a healthy and active lifestyle, I was fit and had it all. I was rockclimbing, hiking alot. At that point, I had been on my kidney transplant for 6 years, and I was feeling pretty healthy despite a couple of hiccups and rejection episodes.

We were hiking and rockclimbing, road tripping together, we had a blast. We felt like soulmates, never arguing, always on the same page. 

Couple years into the relationship, we bought our house, adopted a dog, the year after, we adopted a 18 month old baby girl (that came with its set of challenges, but we overcame them like champs). 

After we welcomed our little girl, or maybe a l
ittle bit before that, when we moved farther from the gym, I stopped working out and rockclimbing. Also, my kidney function was decling, so I started to feel less and less energetic. 

Since then, my kidney function continued to decline to the point that I am now in the process of qualifying for my second kidney transplant, but not sick enough (yet) to start dialysis. I stopped working in April, tried to come back to work in June, and then realized in August that I wasn't able to work anymore at all. Or at least not before either I start dialysis treatments, or get my second transplant (which will be years from now since I don't have a living donor). 

So taking anti-rejection medication, and having lived with chronic kidney disease for so long, come with sides effects. In the last years, I have had all sort of issues coming out. I started having gout crisis in both my feet, I have issue with my tongue (witch is not pretty at all and affects my self confidence), I have chronic diarhea, trouble sleeping, extreme fatigue, often sick with different viruses, etc. I try to go through life without complaining, and honestly, I have been really successful at it so far... but here comes the catch. 

I am at a low point lately, and I feel like I would need some emotional support. But at the opposite, I'm feeling like my partner is distancing himself from me. Not providing any emotional support, it even feels like he is annoyed when he sees I am limping because I have a Gout episode. But I'm trying so hard to remain functional, doing some cleaning during the day (because I am not working, now), trying to give him a hand in the yard during the weekend. 

Could he be falling out of love with me because he doesn't have admiration towards me anymore, I am not the woman who has a chronic condition, but who attacks the world and makes in the 6 digits despite my disease. I know he was proud of that, and our house, our accomplishments and all. It feels like he sees me declining day by day (I'm litterally declining) and he cannot cope with that. 

Also, I'm feeling like I'm always the one initiating touch, or a caresse. There is no intimacy whatsoever lately. 

I know I need to have a discussion with him, telling him I have been feeling really lonely, that I need him. But I think I'm scared of how the discussion can go...

He, on the other hand, hasn’t really done any programs or taken classes in prison to better himself. Sometimes he talks about selling his own sleep aid or anxiety meds in there, which worries me.

We have been dating for around a year and a half, and were friends for 2 years before we started dating. Since the beginning we have always talked about going to Paris together, since we both shared this overly-romanticized idea of going, and neither of us have been. Personally  it has always been my dream to go. I live a really shitty life and the idea of being there at some point in the future comforts me. After we started dating and ALSO finding someone that shares the exact same dream as me, that fantasy changed and in my head she would be there with me whenever i imagined it. We have discussed it multiple times that we are going to go, we even spent days looking for where to stay and what to do. We never ended up sealing the deal mostly due to work or financial obstacles. But i was never discouraged as i know and felt that at some point we would go there.  

around 3 months ago she mentioned that she is getting very sick of her lifestyle in the U.S, which i totally understand, and then we spoke about Paris again, that we need to decide when to go and that we should do it. I also need a break from my day to day as i am getting so mentally drained. (I am diagnosed with severe anxiety and clinical depression). 

Then around a month ago she texts me out of the blue that she got tickets to go, and she has booked everything and that she will go sometime this week. This completely shattered me because I thought we were going to do it together. I felt really betrayed that it was not discussed beforehand. I know for a fact she did not do it with intention to hurt me. But after talking about it for years and it becoming this huge thing between us, for her to just kinda book and decide within a day to go by herself just really hurt. She was aware that i was also not well and would have loved to go aswell. This has completely ruined everything for me, to the point that i dont ever want to go there anymore, not with her, not by myself.

My initial reaction was that i was ecstatic, and excited for her. But i was furious.

I cannot stand to see or speak to her, so i have not seen her in a month but we have texted eachother once a week, just to check up. Since i have asked her for some time to myself to deal with my own issues. 

im just not sure how to go about it, because i would like to forgive her. Since she has no idea this issue even exists, which i would like to keep that way until she returns next week, as to not spoil her trip. Because i know how much it means to her.

I need advice on how to approach the situation, and also how to forgive her by the time she returns.",1756552188.0,,1756570042.0,False,True,N/A,,False,False,False,False,False,0.87,N/A

So
2 days ago, while we were buying some thing in her phone, and solving a problem with an a payment, she received a message saying something like ""so today will you let me see your…? I don’t read more but she instantly tensed up, swiped away the notification, avoided opening her messaging app, and rushed us to leave like “noo just go home please, but her hands shaking 
Why actin like this? 
I say ok and I stand up to get away my bike, she immediately get her phone and replied secretly, I later saw she’d responded because he responded to her again with an emoji that I couldn’t see 
Days earlier, I noticed her taking her phone to the bathroom for 15+ minutes (ran the toilet but after 15 minutes he came out but didn’t wash hands) in that moment it just was a normal event but I  related it to that immediately it is normal?
So I decided to confront her, but she didn’t know how to respond she gave vague excuses like ""I was stressed about shopping/cramps, it’s just someone annoying"", couldn’t explain WHO it was??? or WHY she allowed such comments????, and admitted she’d deleted the chat BEFORE our talk, because I asked her if she had a problem with showing me the chat but she said to me “the problem is that I deleted it” but in her body language I noticed that she were doubting a lot 
She nodded silently as I expressed hurt but offered no clarity at all, I just tell her that her answers were just no coherent, in some point she say that she know that it was wrong but she has not given it importance to tell me but like her actions and her reaction in the moment of the message??
I never had a history of jealousy or anything this secrecy is new, i finished the conversation because I wanted she had the opportunity to thing better and give me an honest explanation

Even before met officially we were messaging on snap, and he would send me dick pics. I was so young I probably didn't think too much about it, but he would have a kink about either feet pics in return and sending 'small' dick pics for me to laugh at him, essentially an embarrassment kink. We have like I say been together 8 years and other than this it is the perfect relationship we love each other so much and he always supports me. 

However, this is still happening. Even sometimes I'm sat downstairs watching TV, he is upstairs and he will text me with small pics/videos. Especially in the early stages of our relationship, I would get random people add me on Snapchat sending me dick pics. Eventually I asked him if he ever made fake accounts to send me pictures, which he said yes to. It's now progressed to in recent years he would offer me money in return, such as 10 sometimes even 40 pounds. He sometimes talks about my friends if they've ever seen his penis, if they've laughed about it. Afterwards, especially if I've been upset about what's happened, he feels guilty, saying he only likes it in the moment. 

But especially since the money element has started, it's making me feel disgusting. He also sends pictures on purpose of him making himself small, and it's really giving ICK. He talks about if I would cheat or anything like it turns him on. 

I just don't know what to do, I really really love him but it's for to the point where I don't know if he would be satisfied if this wasn't a part of our relationship. And I know this could paint him in a negative light, but when is ay this is a small part of our relationship I can't stress this enough.

My BF found my Reddit somehow and was reading through all my comments and posts and asking me things about them to see if I was telling the truth or something? 

He asked me about serious things about religion and kids and silly, banal things too. He asked what shows I like even though he already read about it! He said a photo he recognized popped up in a local chat but I don’t even post in local chats. It was in a makeup sub that he had zero business being in. 

On top of this he gives me backhanded compliments, has some really weird quirks, always assumes he’s right even when he isn’t, and doesn’t respect my boundaries until I get mad. He criticizes things I do and imposes his own thoughts as if they were mine. 

He’s starting to remind me of a narcissist I once dated but some of my friends think I’m being way too harsh. Others tell me to run. I feel like running but he’s great in other ways so maybe I’m being too harsh??

The worst thing to me is that he HAD to have lied about it, right? Reddit doesn’t just suggest people you may know like other platforms. I can’t figure out how he would’ve found me other than a reverse google image search which is frustrating but the lie… I feel like that is too large of a red flag to ignore.

Of course we had some arguments but we have always talked things through. We are both spiritually and we believe we are twin flames. But recently he started talking to a girl from the gym... They have never actually met in real life, they have just seen each other a couple of times there. She followed him on IG and my boyfriend followed her back. Then she messaged him with just a simple ""hi"" and he replied... and after that they started talking.

When I asked what that was all about he said it was just a joke between him and his personal trainer, because when they have nothing to talk they rate people and gave this girl a 10/10. He said it was nothing serious, he was going to show the message to his trainer, then stop replying.

But that didn't happen, so he lied to me. Still, I love him so we talked it out again, and he promised to end the conversation. That night, I checked his phone and saw they were still chatting on IG using disappearing messages. I brought it up the next day and he said it's just ""a way of texting' and that he would never cheat on me, he's just being friendly.

It led to a huge fight, but once again we tried to talk things out.

Later that night, I checked his phone again, and found a photo of the girl saved in hidden folder. I showed it to him the next day, and somehow I ended up being the bad girl. He said I was toxic and disrespecting his privacy by snooping through his phone. Btw I rarely checked his phone before.

The next day, the girl unfollowed him and he messaged her something like ""thanks for the unfollow, bye"" as if he was upset that the girl unfollowed him.

I take money out for tattoos, and keep the rest in a stash for future tattoos. I never use the cash except for tattoos, because I have germophobia and don't like touching it.

 I live at home with my mum and stepdad. After the first few times they said I must've just lost it, but then it kept happening, so we changed the locks. Still, it kept happening, so I put it in a safe. It was fine until I accidentally left the safe open and then it the money missing again. I've now lost thousands of pounds.

I'm very close with my mum and fully trust her but I had doubts about my stepdad. He swore it wasn't him. I put a secret camera in my room and whilst I was away - low and behold, I caught him trying to get in my safe.

I'm devastated. I should tell my mum she's married to a lying thief, but here are the options: either she denies it and sides with my stepdad and ruins our relationship, or she ends things with him and then has to afford her house by herself, and her mental health isn't great, so she would be destroyed.

My brother's wedding is in a month and my stepdad is one of the groomsmen. If I tell my mum now, it will ruin things for the wedding. I don't want to do anything that will overshadow my brother's big day. I also want to tell my brother or his fiancee but again, same issue.

If I move out, then wait until after the wedding to tell her and she decides to end things with him, she will need emotional and financial support but I will be stuck in a rent contract so I can't move back in with her.

I'm also not too keen on moving out to live ny myself because I'm quite mentally unstable myself and my job is absolutely awful; I'm on the verge of being written off sick because of the stress it's giving me. Moving out would mean I'm stuck in that job for the near future. 

I have a boyfriend but he lives somewhere that isn't commutable for my job. I don't have anyone else in the area who I could temporarily live with. I am looking at jobs in his area but I haven't had success yet.

I've therefore also thought about going back to uni. But again, I'm nervous about what will happen if my mum needs help.

For a while I’ve been debating if I should post but I feel like you guys would give me my sanity and clarity again. Long story short our first 2/3 years were great few downs but more ups. I was 22 at the time and addicted to cocaine. She came to my life by Facebook dating. I know red flag already. Basically we hit it off from there. At first I didn’t know she had a child until I came to her place and saw her. Her name is Luna and she came up to me already saying “dad”. I was really rough back then barely had a stable job basically living with her at her mom’s job free like a bum. Obviously that changed I got a job and stuff felt okay. I’m not the type to go out or go spending money at bars but she is. I always wanted to go with her and do her favorite things but every time I felt like I was put in the back burner. Basically once we see her friends she wasn’t by me no more just with her friends. Our first major issue was before all this when a Facebook post she posted on my Facebook while it was jokingly posted my family commented on it right away. She did not take this lightly and from that day forth she refuses to get along with my family. This issue is still brought up to this very day. Fast forward she leaves to go party I don’t care just come home. One night I leave with her to a party by 12/1 I was done and wanted to go home. Well she wasn’t ready to go and just said leave me here. Didn’t come back until the next morning after going AFK. After all this I should have left but I did not. I left briefly but I’m in love it’s been 2/3 years she’s been there for me. So we keep going I get an apartment after her moms 2 bed 2 full bath. Was not the best of places but I’m young I’m trying to make it work. Mind you she does not work and barely wants to clean. And I still put up with it we make it through the lease and go back to her moms. Once there lots of other things are going on she’s leaving whenever just doing her and disregarding me always. One day I get back from work and all my stuff is outside her moms and I’m like huh? She basically told me it’s over I don’t want you here and so I left. She wanted me to keep helping her with rides and stuff but no I’m done. I find out she’s with another guy already and she’s telling me he’s like her best friend. I accepted it and move on. 5/6 months past I’m still hurt but I’m doing me. I finally got my promotion at work and making decent money. I’m traveling the country and seeing things and next thing you know she shows up at my job with Luna telling me how much she loves me. After months of just trying to get over it she’s here begging me. I should have denied her I should have let it go but I didn’t. I went back hoping she sees I would take care of her I just want her loyalty. Before Christmas of this year I decided to lease an townhome for us. Expecting her to cherish this more than our run down apartment. She loves it her child gets to run around the yard and we have space. She works at her child school and we both work down the street from our homes. I pay all the bills and she just needs to make sure the house is good. Still isn’t good enough…. Yesterday she accidentally handed me her phone it was unlocked. Scared but knew it was time to know the truth I looked. And of course she’s talking to someone. I was shocked not sad but upset I keep letting this happen. I love her I love her daughter so much like she’s mine but I can’t take being called controlling and crazy for having a gut feeling. Her name is on the lease I’ve contacted my landlord to try to get her removed. We are 6 months in and I was trying again to keep it together but I just can’t no more….,1751827011.0,,False,False,True,N/A,,False,False,False,False,False,1.0,N/A

I’m writing this in a bit of an emotional state, so I apologize if it comes off as jumbled.

My girlfriend and I have been together for almost three years. We’ve had our ups and downs—some my fault, some hers—but over time, we’ve grown to genuinely love each other.

This past year has been especially difficult for me. My parents divorced, I went through a rough patch where I was couch surfing and stuck in a dead-end retail job, and eventually I managed to land a solid job in IT and moved into a more stable (though modest) living situation with my mom.

Since the beginning, my girlfriend has always been emotionally intense and very dependent on me. From what she’s shared, she’s been this way in past relationships as well. In the earlier part of our relationship, I found it endearing. She’d go out of her way to make me little gifts, do favors, or help around the house—and I appreciated that. But earlier this year, we moved in together, and I’ve started to notice some things that I didn’t pick up on before.

My family has a history of obesity and diabetes, so I try to take my health seriously. I work out regularly, eat clean, and generally try to stay productive. My girlfriend doesn’t share these habits. Over the past year, this difference has become more obvious. She doesn’t exercise, and even something as simple as a walk around the neighborhood requires a lot of persistence on my part. Her default seems to be doing the bare minimum—she mostly just wants to play video games, watch Netflix, have sex, or go shopping.

I don’t want to sound harsh, but I’ve also noticed she struggles with self-esteem. For example, I had a female friend I used to game with online—someone I’ve never met in real life—and she gave me an ultimatum to choose between that friend or her.

What’s been weighing on me the most happened a few months ago. She had a breakdown and admitted, in tears, that she feels like she’s lazy, has no drive, and mostly does things out of convenience. It was a moment of vulnerability that hit me hard. I comforted her, and she eventually pulled out of that rut, but the way she described herself stuck with me. It felt like I got a glimpse of how she really sees herself—and maybe how she really is.

Since getting my new job and settling into a routine, I’ve become more focused on my future and goals. We’ve talked about living together long-term and starting a family, but lately, I’ve felt like I either have to push her to take care of herself or tiptoe around her to avoid conflict. It’s exhausting. I even started therapy a while ago to cope with all the stress—from work, family, and our relationship—but I haven’t been in a few weeks.

To be clear, this relationship isn’t without its good moments. We’re very compatible in terms of interests, background, and family dynamics. We get along well most of the time. But I’m feeling emotionally drained. It’s like she’s depending on me for everything, and I barely have space to breathe. I’m constantly giving, and I’m just tired.

I do love her, and I want the best for her. But I’m starting to question whether I can keep going my like this. I’m not sure what to do anymore.

⸻

TL;DR:
Been with my girlfriend for nearly 3 years. We moved in together recently, and I’ve started to feel emotionally drained. She’s very dependent on me, doesn’t take care of herself, and admits to being unmotivated. I love her and we have good compatibility, but I feel like I’m suffocating and constantly carrying the emotional weight. Not sure if I should keep trying or let go.",1751740916.0,,False,False,True,N/A,,False,False,False,False,False,0.9,N/A

Dated for a couple of years and got married.

During our dating period, he confessed he had a girlfriend but is parted with her in mutual consent (due to cultural and age difference) but still keeps in touch as friends. I never thought that would be an issue provided he was always transparent with me.

After we got married and started staying together, I realized he chats with the girl daily. It's not like he's hiding it, I have access to his device and could read all their chats, there are nothing that would suggest they are cheating but the way they talk gives me bad feelings. 

The talk mostly revolves around the girl asking suggestions for everything she do and feel. She shares gossip about her friends and family. It's her who starts the small talk and my husband replies without fail.

I too have personally met and talked with this girl in past but she's neutral towards me. There's not much to suggest that these two are meeting without me knowing but I'm getting suspicious that they might have other ways to contact. One thing that troubles me is he has helped her financially (small amount) a couple of times even after our marriage without my prior knowledge. It was on chat and I discovered it later when I looked at it. We both earn but we pool our savings and ought to notify each other if we are spending our money on non-basic things. 

I have had once suggested him to completely stop talking to her (while we were dating) but he brushed me off saying she's his friend and I can't just make him stop talking to his friends. 

He don't have many friends either. He loves me and there is nothing to complain about his behavior towards me. So I'm in dilemma whether to make him stop talking to that girl or not. I'm his wife and if I insist enough, he would have no options but stop talking to her. But I also feel that I might be overthinking and crossing the line by making him stop to the only close friend he have.",1751548778.0,,False,False,True,N/A,,False,False,False,False,False,1.0,N/A

He says it's to only be friends and I'm having a hard time trusting that.  Honestly. I reached out to her (we were friends at one point in my marriage) and she is totally ok being the other women. She told me that she won't stop trying to be in a relationship with him, he is a catch and she wants us to divorce. 

He thinks I'm crazy for wanting her blocked. I think that if we truly want to move on and work on our relationship, she should not be part of our lives. At this point, I said an ultimatum that if she's going to be part of our lives that I'm going to file for divorce. Any advise helps.

And as someone who use to get upset about not having sex for a week or two, you might be able to comprehend how much this relationship has changed me. I don’t complain about it, I don’t talk about it, it’s never mentioned anymore. There is also the aspect that he offers zero physical affection at all. In fact if I try to touch him in anyway shape or form he pushes me away or tells me I’m overwhelming him. He blames this on him being insecure which I can understand. But after 3 years together? When does it end? There is also no emotional connection that I can seem to find. He doesn’t have much interest in knowing who I am deep down. He refuses to do things the way I appreciate them.  Example: if I’m upset or having a hard day, he either tells me I’m being too negative and he doesn’t want to listen or he only offers the bright side to every issue I have.

Something is always fault. Someone’s fault. Even if it’s her own.  Maybe mostly herself. She can be so harsh to herself. But I find it so wearing and difficult.

So the two examples today were not massive but just sour. I was playing a game with our kid (2) who was hiding in a big cardboard box and we were pushing object through a hole into and out of the box. At one point I put a small ball through the hole and it bumped my kids face and she got upset.  My partner launches this quick sneering, shame/blame, “what’s wrong with you” thing at me and i feel really fucked off.  Like this amplified blame/shame/guilt thing makes the moment so much more horrible. And I don’t get to feel bad for/with my kid in whatever way I might. I now just have to deal with her shit. I get that it’s unpleasant for your kid to get upset and it’s a kinda quick reactive moment but it does something deep for me! I hate it. I don’t wanna speak to anyone that way. It feels like it’s contempt thats been waiting to find some little opportunity to lash out and sneer at me. Or like there’s something that she feels but can’t own and so it builds in this nasty place and comes out these moments. This time it was with our kid but it could be not closing the fridge door properly or whatever, I get this sneering “what’s wrong with you” thing. 

Then the other one was she told me this thing today. (Context we both work with theatre, performance, dance etc) that a friend told her they had noticed I closed my eyes or fell asleep in show the other night (I didn’t sleep i just closed my eyes). And the way she told me was as if, of course, I should be embarrassed or shamed receiving this information. Also the way that first she made it sound like the friend thought this was embarrassing but when probed a little it wasn’t like that they just said they saw I’d closed my eyes. Her point was that maybe I should think about how the performer might feel if you fall asleep. Ok fine. but it’s done through this way that when I discover I might have done something others judge I would feel the force of some normative shaming power making me correct my misdeed / do what she is trying to talk about.  
Why do that? Rather than just say, hey OP I think it might make the performer feel bad if you close your eyes.

I know this is maybe small and particular but I’m finding it harder and harder. Maybe cos she’s also having a hard time. Maybe it’s getting worse because we’ve moved to Sweden where she’s from and I feel like maybe this thing is a bit cultural. Even if it’s a “open” sociality with a ‘social democratic’ history It feels like a really normative culture maintained by an internalised judgement from other people.  
 
It for sure also touches some shit from how my dad treated me. But maybe that’s why I wanna feel safe from that stuff in my relationship. And it makes me wonder about the ethos we have for our relations. Building a dynamics for our kid. It feels kinda abstract to bring up and also maybe not a part of herself she seems so safe with herself.  How can approach this… set some boundaries? Does anyone recognise this? Found ways through?

355,2026/2/27,17: 8:59,1kpr6b9,relationshipadvice,I [26M] have a problem with my [25F] girlfriends weight,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationshipadvice/comments/1kpr6b9/i_26m_have_a_problem_with_my_25f_girlfriends/,/r/relationshipadvice/comments/1kpr6b9/i_26m_have_a_problem_with_my_25f_girlfriends/,7,Tank_killa6969,48,"Hello, so this is my first time posting on this subreddit. And a throwaway account obviously.

So my girlfriend and I have been going steady for a little over 2 years now and are talking about moving in together. I love her with all my heart and she loves me the same. We get along perfectly with one another and very very rarely fight. She is extremely bubbly and most of the time has a great attitude. She tries extremely hard in our relationship and I try and match that.

However she is on the heavier side (about 210lbs (95kgs)) and it isn’t weight as in muscle it is fat especially around her tummy area. And I (200lbs 90kgs)) am fairly well toned and do an outdoor job that requires me to be relatively fit. I also don’t indulge in sweets and junk food in general. I have a semi strict diet of meat,vegetables, and only drink water 80% of the time. Where as she has a rather large sweet tooth and eats ice cream and junk food on a regular basis.

She does realize that she is overweight and has had a gym membership in the past but has always given up within the first 2 months despite my encouragement. Her family and especially her older brother [28M] has told her she has a weight issue and she took it very poorly. And was calling him an A-hole etc etc. her mother [51F] and grandmother [75F] have said the same thing. Which again she didn’t take well. (Note: both of her brothers [24M] & [28M] play basketball and do power lifting so they are fairly active).

When she was told the aforementioned things about her weight she has gone as far as to book a weight loss surgery but soon after cancelled it after she felt the comments blew over. And I can’t convince her to exercise because she doesn’t see immediate results. and she doesn’t want to get a surgery anymore which I also tried to indirectly support

So the reason why I’m posting this is because just this past weekend I took her out to a faire (not saying what type or which one to keep things anonymous). And all she seemed to want to do is indulge in sweets like butter tarts and ice cream which she did end up doing. And I looked on at the plenty of other women with much thinner profiles and got kind of sad/discontent/upset. Not at her but at the situation. 

So my questions the the community areAm I being too shallow? how can I tell her nicely that her weight bothers me? What are potential options or ultimatums I can give her without seeming like the bad guy?

Thank you for taking the time to read.

Let me preface by saying that Im aware that a lot of my issue is likely my own insecurities and negative past experiences and I am actively trying to not project here. I also realize that it's decently early on in our relationship and some of the factors that play into this are my own.

We've been dating for almost 8 months. He's literally almost perfection in my eyes. I've had a string of bad relationships in my life and prior to him, I was completely single for about 5 years. He's a good man and unless he somehow completely flips script, that opinion of him will not change.

My problem is I'm worried he isn't exactly looking for a future. He says he is, but that just further confuses me because when it comes to him allowing me into his family life, that's practically non-existant. He spends a lot of his time with his family, and while that is actually a green flag to me, it doesn't seem a priority to him to involve me in that in any capacity. 

He has a son who is a preteen that I have met once. He seemed excited about that happening, but after we met....no further plans or discussion has evolved into it happening again. He gets his son on the regular (also a big green flag,) and said the kiddo liked me a lot. But I'm fairly confident that my role is just ""dad's occasional girlfriend"" and nothing more. Not that I'm trying or even want to take a more active role, my kiddos are grown. 

Part of me feels like I'm being too impatient. But the same feeling comes around when it comes to his family. He hasn't ever really initialed a conversation about me meeting his parents, which he travels to see usually once or twice a month. He calls me every night when he's home, but on family weekends he has to ""sneak away"" to call me, even if he does. Generally he doesn't even call. (He will text.) I'm trying to fight the anxiety that maybe they don't like the idea of him dating, even tho he's well over a year out of his divorce.

I mentioned something about meeting his family and he said he didn't want me to feel like it was too soon and said we will plan something for this summer. But that was a couple weeks ago and nothing else has been said. I don't want to bring it up again because I want him to want to, not feel like I'm pushing for it. 

Anyway, there is a lot more to me having the gut feelings about this, but I'm trying to keep it short(er) for posting sake. Like previously mentioned, a lot of the time issues are mine.....I work 2 jobs and have a farm. As is, we only see each other about one weekend a month. (A weekend he doesn't have his son.) I also certainly don't want to impose on family time. 

He has met 2 of my kids, several of my friends, and even my parents briefly. When he talks about the ""future,"" he definitely hints at the fact that there will be no moving forward with *us* until his kid is grown. As in, no moving in together (which, admittedly, would be an ""interesting"" scenario to figure out with all factors involved.) He wants to eventually move closer to his parents, which would involve moving a state away. All well and good for me, honestly, if we can work it out. But again, I just feel like I'm kind of a ""placeholder"" for the time being and not sure if this ""seeing each other once a month on a casual basis"" is going to be what I want for 6ish years. The time frame I suppose I could handle. It's more about the feelings of things just being casual for that long. ",1747402178.0,,1747402640.0,False,True,N/A,,False,False,False,False,False,1.0,N/A

We've known each other for many years, been together for almost two years, and engaged for almost one year. We don't have a wedding date in mind, but we are currently in the beginning stages of house hunting. He is seriously the most incredible person I've ever met. He and I get along so well, we have such cohesive personalities, values, senses of humor, and life goals. I never thought I found find someone who both makes me so truly, deeply, and unflinchingly happy. Our relationship is good. I wish I had words for how much I love him. The space I hold in my heart for this man is just so big. 

The reason I am writing to preemptively ask for advice on how to navigate this relationship when I inherit some money. I am very fortunate to be receiving a sizable trust from my late grandfather on my 30th birthday in July. It's around $1.5 million dollars. He knows about the trust; I told him not long after we got together. 

Both of us are pretty ""self sufficient"" with our money. We pay separately on dates and set strict gift limits for birthdays, holidays, etc. We are both teachers in a state consistently ranked in the bottom 40s for teacher pay. We're used to having to be frugal; we have to save up for long periods of time to be able to take a trip somewhere. We both became teachers knowing good and well money would probably be tight for most of our lives. Except, it doesn't have to be, not for us. 

The thing is, I have been growing more and more nervous that this money is going to change our relationship. I know the saying that ""money changes people"" but I don't want it to create a rift between us. I already foresee some cases in which it may cause tension: I know he is uncomfortable with the prospect of me making large purchases for him. For example, his car is currently on the fritz. It's almost as old as we are. When I suggested I would be happy to pay for a new car, once the money comes in, it was clearly a non-starter of a suggestion. 

While his refusal disappointed me, I wasn't mad. If the roles were reversed, I'd have declined as well. I keep telling myself to imagine I was in his shoes, and think about how I'd feel. I'm never going to pressure him into letting me buy things for him or whatever. I will continue to respect his boundaries. At the same time, I want to be able to help him where I can. And I want to use some of the money to allow us to enjoy fun experiences and trips and such. 

That's why I'm here asking for relationship advice. I desperately don't want this money to sour our relationship. He is the most important person in my life. If anyone has been in a similar situation, please share any advice you have. 

TL:DR - I'm about to inherit $1.5 million dollars, and I want advice on how to maintain the healthy, loving relationship I currently have with my partner. ",1746147943.0,,False,False,True,N/A,,False,False,False,False,False,0.8,N/A

364,2026/2/27,17: 8:59,1k46ysl,relationshipadvice,[45F] just told me why she hasn't been to my house in 6 months [45M],https://www.reddit.com/r/relationshipadvice/comments/1k46ysl/45f_just_told_me_why_she_hasnt_been_to_my_house/,/r/relationshipadvice/comments/1k46ysl/45f_just_told_me_why_she_hasnt_been_to_my_house/,6,Suspicious-Driver-19,7,"How would you respond?

We've been together for 10 years. I've recently moved into a new house, well a year ago now. My girlfriend has been over 4 times, the last time was 6 months ago. 

I stay at her house 3 to 4 times per week. We both have parts of the week when our children are either with us, or with their other biological parent. 

A couple of months ago i asked why she hadn't been over here much  and she said it was because I hadn't invited her. I didn't think she needed an invite but ok, I respect what she said and started to invite her regularly and tried to male sure she knew she was welcome. 

We live about a 30 min drive from each over.

Every time I asked she gave a reason for her not to come, like work, or childcare, or busy, or tired, etc..I've always accepted her reasons but was always disappointed inside, but tried to not let it show as she always gave a valid reason why she couldn't come over.

Last week she snapped at me and asked why I expect her to keep coming over. I said I don't. She asked why I keep inviting her. I replied because you previously told me you hadn't been over because I hadn't invited you. 

We both have dogs, and they always visit with us. 

She has just told me that she doesn't come to my house because I do not allow the dogs to sleep upstairs in the bedroom with us, but at hers the dogs are allowed to sleep in the bedroom. She said she doesnt like the inconsistency. She did mention last time she came here, 6 months ago, that she wasn't happy the dogs had to sleep downstairs. I didn't know she meant she wasn't coming back because of it. She did not say that.

The actual reason is fine. I'm not upset atbthe reason shes given. Together we can come up with a solution that works for us both. 

But I feel really upset that she's only just told me that's why she hasn't been coming over. I didnt know there was a specific reason she was  never gping to come over ever again. If i knew there was a reason, I would have addressed it.I don't know why she lied to me every time. I feel gutted. I feel like it's a big thing to keep from me. She doesn't know why I'm so upset.

She is saying I shouldn't be upset as I knew what the problem was. But she didn't tell me she wouldn't come over.

Everytime I've asked her to come over she's given me various reasons to not come, but never the dog thing. 

Additional info...at her house, her dogs, and mine when they are there, have a habit of going to toilet in the bedroom in the night. I've suggested they all stay downstairs but she isn't keen.
At my house, I have new carpets so don't want them soiled. 

My problem isn't the dog and  carpet thing,  we can work out how to resolve that. I'm upset that she hasn't been here for 6 months and I didn't know why.

Also, her passion is interior design. I'm rubbish at things like that and have been asking her for help with making my new house look nice. My house is very plain looking compared to hers and I keep asking if she can help me make it look nice.

I also can't help but think she's just made this up as an excuse and still hasn't told me the real issue, if there is one. Maybe it's too much effort for her to drive over and the dog thing works as a good excuse

Around 5 years ago we jointly agreed to move from our home state to another state in the US. We both loved it and things were mostly great. 
She has two kids from a previous marriage whom are now adults and the eldest got married/ gave her her only grandchild back in our home state. She says the birth of her grandchild changed the way she feels and her plan is to move back to our home state so she can be with her grandchild and her family (mom, dad, brother, son, daughter, grandchild, etc). 
However I’ve declined to join her for a multitude of reasons including I’m so happy with the life we built in our new state (for 5 years) - friends/work/ hobbies I’ve established would be gone if I left and I would be miserable going back which I’ve been clear in communication. I’m sad my wife has chosen to leave me for her grandchild but I understand and we’ve both stated we would remain friends and support each other despite separating when she leaves to move back.
I felt we were getting along and managing this slow I’ve explained how I felt hurt and betrayed. She explained how she feels angry I won’t join her in moving. She said she is sorry for hurting my feelings. We still live together and have minimal contact. I am leaving home when she’s getting home from work because I don’t see a way forward beyond avoiding being around so I limit whatever perceived slights she feels I’m responsible for. I feel as though I can never know if she’s trash-talking about me or not so avoiding contact limits what she can complain about. ( In her text I was upset she’s‘packing up the whole house’ and not appreciating that she’s replacing things she plans to take with her move such as a can opener and not appreciating she’s making repairs in our home such as filling nail holes in the walls). She told me she hopes I would change my mind to join her in our old state during the summer and our home now would be better prepared to long term rent out.

I always have to be the person that shows up for both of us all the time and it just very draining. We both came to relationship with kids. I have one kid he has three kids. So you would think that is enough but no. He always mentioning babies and getting me pregnant which makes me uncomfortable. And he knows it makes me uncomfortable because I told him but doesn’t care. Unfortunately I had to get an abortion at the end of January which he did not help pay for. He was not supportive at all didn’t really talk me until the process was over. We are now in April and I’m pregnant again. He has been lying tell me he isn’t doing certain things while we have sex  but I know it’s definitely a lie at this point. I definitely take responsibility for me being this position again because I should have left him alone but I do feel like he planned this to happen yet again. I do feel like it is to trap me due to the things he says to me. If I was to express that I was happy about this pregnancy he would hop on board and express his excitement. I not in the head space or in the position to take care of two kids by myself. Does it sound like he is trying to take advantage and trap me. Please give advice or kind words.

I (26F) and my boyfriend (23M) have been dating for over a year. We recently moved in together, but the tension is at an all-time high.

We met each other in November 2023. We began dating in February 2024. In May, we both lost our jobs, my boyfriend struggled a bit to find a job. He finally landed one in September, but he got sick (diagnosed with Type 1 diabetes). I supported him through it, and I still am, but because of his illness, he lost his job. He started searching for a new job again. Around this time, we were planning to move in together because the place he was living in switched owners. Since then, he has refused to actively look for work. He keeps saying ""no"" to job opportunities or making up excuses about why companies won't hire him. He’s home 24/7, constantly complaining about how life isn’t fair and how he doesn’t have money to do the things he likes.

I’ve been really stressed about this because it’s me who has to pay for everything. I work full-time, and when I come home, he hasn’t done any chores. He expects me to do everything while he games. He is always complaining, gaming, or watching TV, and he expects me to do everything. I’ve had multiple conversations with him about how this stresses me out and overwhelms me. He changes his behavior for a week, and then it goes back to the same as before. He constantly says I’m always in a bad mood and that I no longer have intimacy with him. Because of the stress, I’ve also been struggling with my own health lately. He keeps saying I’m the asshole for not giving him intimacy and that he feels unattractive, and that his illness is making everything harder. I keep telling him that if he helped out, we could have intimacy, but nothing changes.

Everything came to a head when he told me he’d rather watch football than spend time with my family. He kept moping like a child about having to go, and I told him I could go on my own, but he kept saying that it would make him look like an asshole. Then, he started complaining about how we only have intimacy once a month and kept going on about it. I snapped at him, walked away for a minute to cool down, and he kept following me, saying I didn’t love him. I finally told him to shut up and that I was going to my mom’s for dinner to get my head straight. He then called me, saying he was going to his mom’s and didn’t know if he would come back tonight. In the past, I would have begged him not to do that, but I didn’t feel that way anymore. I was indifferent. He did show up in the middle of the night and said he didn’t know if things would work out but ignored me for 30 minutes before demanding intimacy. I told him I didn’t feel like it because I was still emotional and we hadn’t made up. He then started saying that I didn’t love him and that I kept going back on my word when I said I was up for it. I was before all of this, but not anymore.

It hit me—I’m starting to get the ""ick."" I no longer want to be near him, but our lease ends in December, and I don’t know what to do or how to end things since this is my first relationship. 


TL;DR: My boyfriend's lack of effort, constant complaining, and refusal to help around the house have made me lose interest in him. I’m overwhelmed and don’t know how to end the relationship

Edit/update: I talked to my landlord and am I am able to stop my contract, which I will be doing. I sat him down and broke up with him. At first he called me every name in the book but now that I moved out he calmed down. Currently busy with moving in again with my mom. Thank you for your advice.

We don’t live together but sleep over one house or the other together every night, planning to move in together within the next few months bc we basically already live together. 

So Thursday night, my partner of 15 months got what we believe is food poisoning - pretty violent vomiting that came with almost no warning, diarrhea, lasted roughly 7 hours and aside from the occasional not great poop due to his digestive system getting back to normal and dehydration, he’s mostly normal, but tired and weak. Thursday night I got no sleep because he actually vomited in bed so I had to clean all the bedding change the sheets and couldn’t get back to sleep before he’d be sick again. I worked from home Friday so I can do all the laundry and take care of him. Since then, he’s been pretty weak, able to hold down food, but still has a lot of discomfort.

I am REALLY bad with vomiting. Seeing it makes me feel like I’m going to throw up also, hearing it gives me the same queasy feeling but not as bad. Having to clean up vomit and sleep/lie in bed next to him while he kept having to get up to be sick was terrible. Every little cough, hiccup, burp, noise he makes makes me jump away from him and ask what’s wrong because I think he’s going to be sick again. even though he hasn’t been sick since Thursday since he’s still been off, I haven’t been able to sleep through the night because of my anxiety. I feel like I handled all of this pretty well considering how much anxiety it gives me, but I feel guilty for being so nervous anytime you make a noise.

I really want to go to my own house tonight and sleep alone so I can get a full night sleep for work tomorrow. I feel so guilty and selfish for feeling this way. He’s my person, I know that if we’re going to spend the rest of our lives together, there will be times where he is sick or I am sick or our kids will be sick and I can’t just leave Because we will be living together and that’s just the way it is. I left about an hour ago, just so I could go to yoga to decompress a little and he started crying because he was going to miss me  and didn’t want me to leave while he was still feeling weak and vulnerable. He said I’ve done such a good job taking care of him and he wants me to stay. It’s not like I’m leaving him alone, his dad lives with him and can take care of him if needed. I’ve literally been by his side since Thursday night except for an hour this morning when I went home to change my clothes and clean a little bit, and a couple of hours Friday night after his dad got home because I had a race to run. I missed a friend‘s birthday party last night and some other stuff this weekend to stay home and take care of him because I care and he wanted me to, but I’m exhausted, feeling a little burnt out and almost smothered by basically lying in bed for three days. 

Sorry for how long this is, I’m pretty long-winded and just wanted everyone to have the whole picture that I feel like a terrible person but I’m kind of at my breaking point with being so on edge for days. Any advice on what I should do or if anyone has stories to share about this type of experience would be appreciated. ",1740959947.0,,False,False,True,N/A,,False,False,False,False,False,1.0,N/A

In 2024 I become employed in a field of work that has provided for us quite well financially but demands crazy hours (anywhere between 55 and 70 a week is the norm). Like I said, it pays incredibly well and I love the work. That said, recently the hours have taken a toll on her. Now, we dont have kids or anything and currently rent a home. Ive been nervous about creating a family due to finances and I have communicated this to her. She recently threatened divorce about a month ago if we didnt really start trying for a child by the time she is 30. Now, I really want a kid. I really do but I also dont want to bring a child into a an unstable home financially. I want the best for them and my wife. So, Ive picked up more hours and have become quite conservative with my funds so I can get my wife a car, place a down-payment for a house, and fix some debt issues. Ive communicated this aswell. Here recently, Ive worked 80 hours weeks back to back but usually have the weekends uninterrupted. Every day it feels like she has complained about the hours and it feels as if she blames it all on me. She wont listen to me when I say what it is all for as I am sacrificing much of myself to see these goals completed. Now, to the real meat and potatoes, Ive talked to her about the funds as she wants to go to a concert and it will be expensive. Her sister wants to go and ,after looking at the finances, I can afford for her to go but she is demanding I go with which makes it even more expensive. I reminded her that when I work these late shifts she needs to look back at this moment as a reminder that we can only afford such things due to my work and the sacrifices I make there which she acknowledged. Now, Valentine's Day weekend, I am on call this weekend and the next. I get a call and work Saturday from 11AM-5AM the next day. I didnt even get to see her which broke my heart. Then, Im called upon again 11AM on Sunday and just returned home. She refuses to speak to me and goes on that my choosing to work for our future is bs and a lie and that I chose work over her. I told her that Ive negotiated being off tomorrow and Tuesday but she wont have it. Says she doesnt care anymore and that she doesnt want anything to do with me anymore. I slave away so she is provided for, doesnt have to work, and gets to focus on herself. Im just lost, confused, and dont know what to do anymore. Ive sacrificed so much and have come so far.

family and a couple of stressful house moves I’ve gained about 4/5 stone (55/70lbs). It was around the time son arrived that my wife, then GF, first noticed the change in my snoring. She has trouble falling asleep and is a light sleeper when she does so as a result my snoring is intolerable.

He had to go back overseas where we came from for another couple months to tie up some loose ends but I stayed in the US with our kiddo by myself.

Meanwhile I am in a hotel with no vehicle, a toddler and 2 cats trying to find housing. He didn’t really help much trying to find one but that’s okay, I ended up finding a really cute house in a safe are and he got back in the middle of summer. We were able to spend some time together before this program he’s in started, which to be quite honest I don’t remember too much other than just trying to make sure he got to do everything he wanted while on leave (see family and friends from home state and go do things around there). I do have to say, I knew that this program was going to be hard and take up a lot of him, but the fact I feel like it’s so far past the roommate stage, this is ridiculous. I am not treated as a partner, barely even an aquaintance at this point. I feel like he treats his classmates better than he does me.

It’s getting to the point where I’m so frustrated I don’t even want to give my opinions since it seems they don’t really matter.

I have talked with her about the insecurity and asked her to get some therapy.

How can I get him to understand that I will not have and have not had, any romantic relationships with my close guy friends? We've been together for a year now. He says he has no problem with me hanging out, but hes uncomfortable. 

A bit of background: i'm a gamer who grew up on the internet, and I have a fear of women that I am working on. I have mostly male friends with a handful of girl friends and I'm working hard to balance this out in my life. My boyf is a bit more traditional in upbringing, doesnt think men and women can really be platonic friends (men are just trying to get in their pants) and while respectful, specifically doesnt really speak to women unless he has to.

Anyway, hes very uncomfortable with the fact that I hang out with my group of guy friends alone. Usually its me, 3 guys and 3 girls. We are all pretty close and ive known them for almost a decade at this point. Sometimes the other ladies cant make it and dont come or they come out and end up leaving. Sometimes i know its just the guys and I go out to hang out. Ill ask them all if theyre free and whoever is free we just chill. We arent doing anything weird, it's literaly watching movies or going to the mall or going to dinner/lunch/drinks, and usually i go out when my boyfriend is busy but he has joined us a handful of times.

I dont know what to do at this point. I've tried to accommodate a lot, by txting him exactly where i am who I am with, adjusting my outfits if he thinks theyre too inappropriate, not making specific jokes with my friends anymore, stopped going out with them 1 on 1 unless I need to drive them home. He says he cant get over it but its not worth splitting up over, but I think its going to be a big issue for us if he cant at least learn to deal with it within himself.

I feel frustrated because I dont know how to tell him that none of my friends see me that way and I dont see them thst way at all. When he asks to reverse the roles, I get it. I would feel weird and jealous. But I would look for signs and see how they act and the only thing I can do is trust my boyfriend.

When these arguments happen, I tell him how I feel and he apologizes, but it doesn’t feel sincere. It feels like he’s saying sorry to get me to stop complaining. It’s gotten to the point where I don’t want to talk to him for risk of starting an argument. 

I recently told him this after one of these arguments, and was met with a big sigh, and was told that wasn’t right. That conversation eventually fizzled out without a great conclusion, and we went about our night like nothing happened. 

For context, we were supposed to clean the house together today (a date that he picked) but then he realized he was supposed to go to a concert with a friend today. I was frustrated, and expressed it poorly because I was originally going to make plans. 

I had to call him to see if the laundry was done (he does the laundry and I needed a shirt for work).

He doesn’t answer, I call him again, he doesn’t answer, I text him (call me ASAP) and he finally calls me back already pissed off.

I ask him if he did laundry today (he does the laundry I do the dishes), he didn’t, I ask if he did yesterday, he didn’t, and then he’s upset because I “texted him like I was dying” 

We agreed that nothing we wanted to say to each other was going to be productive so we hung up.

And I’m sure he’s going to feel like I manipulated him by calling him while at the concert because similar situations have happened and he told me that’s how he felt. 

It feels like we’re stuck in a cycle of I ask him a question, he gets defensive, I get upset, we talk it out but don’t reach a conclusion. 

I’m exhausted and at a loss for what to do. I make a tremendous effort to go out of my way to use nonaccusatory language, and insure we’re constantly working towards a successful conclusion, but it feels like it’s met with nothing but frustration or apathy.

How do we fix this as a couple? It’s so exhausting feeling like I don’t matter. ",1752115004.0,,False,False,True,N/A,,False,False,False,False,False,0.76,N/A

When he does have something to say, it’s relevant, quick witted, or a perfectly told story. All his friends think he’s hilarious.

But he’s great and I love him.

I, on the other hand, love to talk shit, have conversations on deep, intellectual subjects, and about my feelings, concerns, and aspirations. I’m an open book. I’ll tell you my entire life story from every memory I’ve kept over the years, nothing off limits.

I’m hoping to get some advice or insight on how to best support my SO. We’ve been together a little over four years and are getting married this summer. She’s incredible—smart, kind, hard-working—and since I’ve known her, she’s worked in various customer service roles, most of which she’s loathed. She’s made it clear that her dream is to work a more behind-the-scenes or nature-oriented job, but she’s stuck where she is.

We moved to a new city two years ago, and not long after, a friend helped her land her current job. She’s been there ever since and, honestly, she’s a rockstar. Her team relies on her, she takes on new responsibilities constantly, and she’s become a vital part of the operation. But… she hates it. Like, cry-after-work hate it. She feels burned out and trapped, and it’s been eating away at her emotionally.

Here’s where I’m stuck: she talks often about wanting to leave, but she never takes any actual steps. No résumé updates. No job applications. No reaching out to recruiters. And when I try to gently suggest she start looking, she shuts down. The main reason? She’s afraid of rejection. She’s been turned down before at the interview stage, and it really hurt her confidence. I totally get it—rejection sucks—but staying in a job that makes her this unhappy isn’t sustainable either.

So, how do I help her move forward? How do I encourage her to pursue something better without making her feel pressured or judged? I just want her to be happy and feel fulfilled, but I’m struggling to find the right balance between support and motivation.

Any advice would be appreciated.

I’m seeking advice about something that’s starting to create friction between my partner and me—our completely different communication styles.

For context, I \[29F\] am someone who likes to talk things out immediately when there’s a disagreement. I process my thoughts through conversation. My partner \[31M\], on the other hand, tends to shut down or go silent when things get tense. He says he needs time to think before responding, but to me, it feels like I’m being ignored or that he’s avoiding the issue altogether.

We rarely fight, but when we do, the conflict usually becomes worse—not because of the actual issue, but because of *how* we’re trying to communicate about it. I end up feeling anxious and push for a resolution, while he feels overwhelmed and pulls away. This pattern leaves both of us feeling misunderstood.

We recently talked about our styles and realized we’ve never really discussed how we *prefer* to communicate. That talk helped a bit, but we still fall into old habits. I’m trying to be more patient, and he’s trying to be more open, but it’s hard.

**I’d love to hear from others**:

* Have you and your partner ever realized your communication styles were very different?
* How did you navigate it?
* What communication habit has helped your relationship the most?

I’m open to advice, tips, or even just knowing we’re not alone in this.

**TL;DR**: I \[29F\] tend to resolve conflicts through talking things out right away, while my partner \[31M\] shuts down and needs space. It’s causing tension.

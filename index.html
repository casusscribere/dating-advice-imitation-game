                <div class="post-content">
                    <p id="contentA">I've been dating my girlfriend for about 3 years now, and she's become a huge part of my life. My best friend and I have known each other since we were kids. Lately, my girlfriend has been expressing concerns about how much time I spend with him. She says she feels like he's always getting in the way of our relationship.

Last night, things came to a head when she asked me to choose between her and him. I was shocked and didn't know what to say. My best friend is really important to me, but so is my relationship. I love my girlfriend, but I also can't imagine my life without my best friend.

I'm completely torn. Has anyone else dealt with a similar situation? How did you handle it? I need some advice because I feel like whatever decision I make will hurt someone I care about deeply.</p>

                <div class="post-content">
                    <p id="contentB">So like, my bf keeps texting this girl from his work and it's been bugging me. He says nothing is going on but I just get this feeling, you know? Like I can feel something off even though he hasn't really done anything wrong that I can prove. 

We've been together for like 8 months and it's been really good but now I'm starting to wonder if I should just snoop through his phone to see what's really going on. I know that sounds crazy but I'm getting more and more anxious about it every day.

My friends say I should just ask him but I feel like if I do he'll just lie to me. I'm stuck between wanting to trust him but also feeling like I need to know what he's talking about with her. What should I do? Is it normal to feel this way or am I being paranoid? Any advice would help honestly.</p>
